Many of the timestamps seem to occur at roughly the same times, suggesting an automated program running on a set schedule. There's been no activity outside user talk from this account for a while and no response to inquiries about these welcome messages.

<p>Hi! Part of the Wiki Ed support system for classes is that <a href="/wiki/User:Ian_(Wiki_Ed)" title="User:Ian (Wiki Ed)">User:Ian (Wiki Ed)</a> and <a href="/wiki/User:Adam_(Wiki_Ed)" title="User:Adam (Wiki Ed)">User:Adam (Wiki Ed)</a> provide support for student editors. The welcome messages get posted (automatically) to the talk pages of users soon after they enroll in the class, by whichever Wiki Ed staff member is supporting that class. Adam has been intermittently sick for the last couple of weeks. We generally have someone else help out when someone is out sick, but these talk page messages slipped through the cracks.</p>
<p>The welcoming of users is something we previously did manually, but switched it to be automatically done by the dashboard at some point. I didn't think of this welcoming feature as a 'bot', separately from the general OAuth approval system, which is why I did not go through the bot approval process at the time that feature was added. I can do so if folks think that's necessary.</p>
<p>I will follow up in more detail later today. In the short term, I've removed the 'greeter' flag from Adam's account (but not Ian's), so the dashboard won't make any further welcome edits on his behalf.--<a href="/wiki/User:Sage_(Wiki_Ed)" title="User:Sage (Wiki Ed)">Sage (Wiki Ed)</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Sage_(Wiki_Ed)" title="User talk:Sage (Wiki Ed)">talk</a>) 16:29, 15 March 2017 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><span class="template-ping">@<a href="/wiki/User:Sage_(Wiki_Ed)" title="User:Sage (Wiki Ed)">Sage (Wiki Ed)</a>:</span> I think it would be useful if you could clarify whether the dashboard makes these welcoming edits automatically, or if the user (i.e. Ian or Adam) have to manually approve each welcome. If it's the former, then that would fall under using a non-bot account as an unapproved bot. <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Bot_Policy" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Bot Policy">Bot Policy</a> requires that a separate account be used, and that it be approved before running. If each welcome is being sent manually, and simply being sent from the interface, there shouldn't be a problem. <a href="/wiki/User:Samwalton9" title="User:Samwalton9"><b>S</b>am <b>W</b>alton</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Samwalton9" title="User talk:Samwalton9">talk</a>) 18:37, 15 March 2017 (UTC)

<dd><a href="/wiki/User:Samwalton9" title="User:Samwalton9">User:Samwalton9</a>: at the level of individual user welcomes, it's automatic.

<p>I've disabled the automatic welcome messages from Ian as well now. It would be pretty simple to convert it to a dashboard-assisted manual welcome, but that seems pretty pointless since we want to make sure every Wiki Ed student editor gets a welcome ping from the person supporting their class, and the sooner after joining the class they get it, the better.

<p>(may be related to the above?)</p>
<p>Question: is the WikiEdu Dashboard ( <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/">https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/</a> ) considered a bot? And if so, has it been approved by en.wikipedia bot-related approval processes?</p>
<p>I bring this up while there has been a problem that from that dashboard en.wikipedia pages can be updated (overriding any content that is on the page) without the dashboard editor being responsive to in-Wikipedia user talk page or project talk page comments by concerned in-Wikipedia editors. Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>affected project page: <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Ed/University_of_North_Carolina_School_of_the_Arts/History_of_Musical_Styles_I_and_II_(Fall_2015,_Spring_2016)" title="Wikipedia:Wiki Ed/University of North Carolina School of the Arts/History of Musical Styles I and II (Fall 2015, Spring 2016)">Wikipedia:Wiki Ed/University of North Carolina School of the Arts/History of Musical Styles I and II (Fall 2015, Spring 2016)</a></li>
<li>unresponsiveness of dashboard operators demonstrated at (among other pages) <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Dr.renMueller" title="User talk:Dr.renMueller">User talk:Dr.renMueller</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Wiki_Ed/University_of_North_Carolina_School_of_the_Arts/History_of_Musical_Styles_I_and_II_(Fall_2015,_Spring_2016)" title="Wikipedia talk:Wiki Ed/University of North Carolina School of the Arts/History of Musical Styles I and II (Fall 2015, Spring 2016)">Wikipedia talk:Wiki Ed/University of North Carolina School of the Arts/History of Musical Styles I and II (Fall 2015, Spring 2016)</a> (and related <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Classical_music/Archive_64#Student_articles" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Classical music/Archive 64">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Classical music/Archive 64#Student articles</a>)</li>

</ul>
<p>Although nothing much happened any more since last year in this example it got stuck in my head as an unresolved issue. Possibly I lost my cool somewhere along the line, but what I remember is that there was a pile of cleanup after the project had passed through Wikipedia – and, frustratingly, no way to contact the people messing up. --<a href="/wiki/User:Francis_Schonken" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Francis_Schonken" title="User talk:Francis Schonken">talk</a>) 09:57, 15 March 2017 (UTC)</p>

<dd>BTW. I think that it is rather strange that WikiEdu asks people to edit something in the dashboard, and then doesn't even allow sysops to actually do so on their pages... That's definitely something that should be rectified.

<dd>Re. "I would call it an alternate editing interface" – yeah, so is AWB I suppose... the question is not whether it is an alternative interface (it is, no doubt about that), but whether it is a bot, and if so, whether it went through due process.</dd>
<dd>The worrying aspect (as I saw it in the experience described above) is that you can ping a dashboard editor, or write on their Wikipedia user talk page or on the talk page of the project as much as you like, none of these messages go through to the "alternative interface" (so the editor there ignores it all, not even knowing a concern has been raised). Thus these dashboard editors continue editing Wikipedia via that interface without being aware about any concern voiced through Wikipedia's usual channels. In that sense it is bot-like: it steam-rolls whatever concern and overwrites Wikipedia content automatically with whatever the Dashboard sends out. --<a href="/wiki/User:Francis_Schonken" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Francis_Schonken" title="User talk:Francis Schonken">talk</a>) 16:09, 15 March 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In as much as it allows Wikipedia to be edited via WikiEdu's tools, and cuts WikiEdu users off from the concerns of Wikipedia's wider community (in effect censoring what messages get through to the WikiEdu users), it's a type of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:OWN" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:OWN">WP:OWN</a>. <a href="/wiki/User:Cabayi" title="User:Cabayi">Cabayi</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Cabayi" title="User talk:Cabayi">talk</a>) 16:17, 15 March 2017 (UTC)

<dd>Really the dashboard needs to go both ways, in that anything on the wikipedia end is copied to the off-site project and vice versa. Its not really acceptable for an offsite dashboard to be in control of a wikipedia page and overwrite it regardless of what wikipedia editors have done in the meantime. Its a core tenet of wikipedia that communication is required *here* between editors.

<dd>The idea with the dashboard on-wiki course pages, like <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Ed/University_of_North_Carolina_School_of_the_Arts/History_of_Musical_Styles_I_and_II_(Fall_2015,_Spring_2016)" title="Wikipedia:Wiki Ed/University of North Carolina School of the Arts/History of Musical Styles I and II (Fall 2015, Spring 2016)">Wikipedia:Wiki Ed/University of North Carolina School of the Arts/History of Musical Styles I and II (Fall 2015, Spring 2016)</a>, is that they provide an on-wiki mirror of the dashboard.wikiedu.org content, so that things like 'what links here' can be used to easily find out which editors are connected with which other editors through these courses. Two-way editing of those is not practical, because the content isn't structured the same way. Those are the only pages that the dashboard quote-unquote 'owns'.</dd>
<dd>In terms of approval process, the system itself went through the OAuth application approval process for the technical side of things, and there was a lot of (well-advertised) on-wiki discussion about the basic concept and using subpages of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Ed" title="Wikipedia:Wiki Ed">Wikipedia:Wiki Ed</a> as, essentially, a replacement for EducationProgram extension that was the previous basis for course pages.</dd>
<dd>The dashboard does not allow arbitrary editing of other pages, and all the actual article editing, discussion, etc, still happens the usual way. --<a href="/wiki/User:Sage_(Wiki_Ed)" title="User:Sage (Wiki Ed)">Sage (Wiki Ed)</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Sage_(Wiki_Ed)" title="User talk:Sage (Wiki Ed)">talk</a>) 17:16, 15 March 2017 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I had already understood that much. Your last words ("... discussion ... still happens the usual way") gloss over the fact that project to project (i.e. between "Wiki Ed" and "en.Wikipedia") communication is structurally near impossible, leading to frustration on both sides (frustration from Wiki Ed project participant's side is for instance documented <a href="/wiki/User:ShannaGabrielle#Reflective_Essay" title="User:ShannaGabrielle">here</a>). So take the interface to <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Bots/Requests_for_approval" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval">Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval</a>, which is about more than the mere technical approval, and for instance also about how the interface blends in with the English-language Wikipedia. I suppose it should be possible to send notifications about a relevant on-wiki discussion to the relevant page in the dashboard interface when a Wiki Ed project setup causes problems in the encyclopedia (like in the Wikipedia interface we get a notification with a clickable link when someone pings us or writes something on our talk page).</dd>
<dd>Several Wikipedia editors, including myself, posted suggestions for a smoother interaction (which ultimately should result in better mainspace content, and better learning curves for Wiki Ed project participants) for future Wiki Ed project setups. I wonder what has been done with those suggestions? (if your reply would be that you didn't see such suggestions, that is kind of a confirmation of my earlier point that the project-to-project communication has in practice proven near impossible). --<a href="/wiki/User:Francis_Schonken" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Francis_Schonken" title="User talk:Francis Schonken">talk</a>) 18:15, 15 March 2017 (UTC)

I've thought a lot about this myself, and I've followed plenty of on-wiki discussion related to it. That said, I'm not sure what specific 'suggestions for smoother interaction' you're referring to here. I'm also not clear what you mean by "communication is structurally near impossible".

<dd>Re. "... at some point" – how about <i>now</i>? Re. "... on-wiki discussion related to it" – linking to some of these (if there are that provide insight) might be helpful.</dd>
<dd>Suggestions for smoother interaction / structural problems with project-to-project communication – apart from "see above" and "click on some of the links I gave above", here are some points I remember: there were some flaws in the setup of the North Carolina project mentioned above (leading to <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:CONTENT_FORK" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:CONTENT FORK">WP:CONTENT FORK</a> problems etc.). Despite several efforts (by myself and others before me) we could not set up communication with the persons responsible for the project setup, in order to correct these flaws (the North Carolina professor...); Then there was the problem that almost all of the issues caused by the project showed up in a period of one or two days (on a few dozen pages), just before all of the South Carolina project editors disappeared from Wikipedia (a few remedies to avoid that in the future were proposed, e.g. timely publication of the due delivery date of the students' work on the project page; work from draft namespace instead of from user talk space; point students to guidelines that are specifically applicable for the topic area where they are going to edit; contact WikiProjects in the area where the editing is going to take place when setting up the project – instead of leaving the cleanup to Wiki editors when communication is no longer possible while everyone who was connected to the Wiki Ed project has left the building, etc...). --<a href="/wiki/User:Francis_Schonken" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Francis_Schonken" title="User talk:Francis Schonken">talk</a>) 20:42, 15 March 2017 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Re. "The Wiki Ed system guides student editors to draft their work on-wiki, communicate about each others' work on-wiki, and interact with other editors on-wiki." Again, you're missing the (direct) project-to-project communication for addressing Wiki Ed project setup issues. Also, for the over two dozen pages I reviewed when cleaning up it was clear that either there had been no communication between the student and regular wikipedia editors (where such communication seemed indispensable), or, in the very few cases when there had been such communication, that communication was highly problematical (see student frustration link I gave above). So, whatever the interface was supposed to do in that respect, it wasn't working. --<a href="/wiki/User:Francis_Schonken" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Francis_Schonken" title="User talk:Francis Schonken">talk</a>) 20:56, 15 March 2017 (UTC)

<dd><a href="/wiki/User:Francis_Schonken" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a>: Thanks. That cleared things up for me somewhat. The core issues, I think, are the same ones that have been the hardest ones for the education program all along: getting newcomers to engage in communication in the ways the Wikipedia community expects is hard. I think there are some ways that improvements to the dashboard can help — especially around facilitating on-wiki communication — but it will take a lot of design and development work to do that right. When you said "project-to-project communication", I at first was thinking in terms of communication between wikipedia.org and dashboard.wikiedu.org. But I think the problems you are pointing to are more fundamentally about how to get editors whose entry point to Wikipedia is the education program — instructors and students — to think and act like experienced editors. My view is that we've gotten a lot better at this over time, and the structure provided by the dashboard is a big part of that. Over the last year, we worked with significantly more classes and students than in previous years, with fewer of these kinds of communication problems. When such things do come up, and people post about them to <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Education_noticeboard/Incidents" title="Wikipedia:Education noticeboard/Incidents">Wikipedia:Education noticeboard/Incidents</a>, we often find ways of improving the process — occasionally technical ways, but usually more along the lines of changes to our training content, our help materials, and our processes for vetting courses and monitoring courses.--<a href="/wiki/User:Sage_(Wiki_Ed)" title="User:Sage (Wiki Ed)">Sage (Wiki Ed)</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Sage_(Wiki_Ed)" title="User talk:Sage (Wiki Ed)">talk</a>) 22:00, 15 March 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<ol>
<li>The "automatic welcome messages" BRFA was withdrawn after a comment that ended with "... Wiki Ed [...] looks like a separate organization and it wouldn't supersede anything on Wikipedia" – if the same is applied to the Wiki Ed project page updates that overwrite all the content on such Wikipedia project pages, this would become impossible by the same reasoning... So that functionality should be disabled immediately, then kept disabled until it passes a BRFA. I'd think (after an initial setup of the project page with the basic content of who is responsible, what the project is about, what the delivery dates are etc), that the talk page of such project page should be used to post incremental messages saying something like "the dashboard page of this edu project has been updated on &lt;date&gt;" (of course with a link to the related dashboard page).</li>
<li>The BRFA for the Dashboard should explicitly include all aspects of (semi-)automatic updating of pages in Wikipedia originating from the Dashboard system. Thus far we've had two: automatic welcome messages (disabled, BRFA withdrawn), and automatic updating of project pages (should immediately be disabled per <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:OWN" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:OWN">WP:OWN</a>, see above) – are there any other (semi-)automatic updating functionalities generated by WikiEdu programs we don't know about yet? If so, ask permission for them via BRFA.</li>
<li>Re. "getting newcomers to engage in communication..." – a quick fix that should at least alleviate some of the problems was proposed above: instruct the students that <i>new</i> articles are better started in Draft: namespace (and not in their user talk namespace where they are usually under the radar of Wikipedia communication until the content is transported to mainspace). Draft: namespace is monitored and students will get feedback, will often be pointed to WikiProjects that have experience in the topic area (leading to more communication), all of that long before the "due date" (which is typically the date when students move their new content to mainspace, after which they typically immediately stop editing Wikipedia). Rewrites/updates of articles that already exist in mainspace should likewise better be kept out of user talk namespace, and should take place directly in mainspace (or via update proposals on the article talk page), where of course there will be, in most cases, immediate feedback, and thus communication, too.</li>
<li>Re. "... — instructors and students — to think and act like experienced editors" – err? I think they should think &amp; act like newbies (which gives extra protection per <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:BITE" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:BITE">WP:BITE</a>). A part of the problem now seems to be that instructors and students, after following the WikiEdu introduction course, think they behave like experienced editors (with the tinge of arrogance that comes with it – excuse my French), but act in ways that upset regular processes and procedures, and write questionable mainspace content (e.g. in a page on a Vivaldi composition they think it is necessary to write a full Vivaldi bio, instead of just linking <a href="/wiki/Antonio_Vivaldi" title="Antonio Vivaldi">Antonio Vivaldi</a>, give an overview of the composer's work, his style and whatnot, writing maybe ten percent of the new article about the composition at hand – without a single reference) – all of which isn't helped when editing from a "I'm an experienced editor" attitude, instead of from "I'm new at this, could I get some assistance?" approach. At the end of the introduction program they should know they are still newbies, so need to keep in touch with more experienced editors to address all sorts of practical issues (e.g. how to add proper references).</li>
<li>Re. <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Education_noticeboard/Incidents" title="Wikipedia:Education noticeboard/Incidents">Wikipedia:Education noticeboard/Incidents</a> – didn't know about that. How about providing a link to that page in the {{<a href="/wiki/Template:Dashboard.wikiedu.org_assignment" title="Template:Dashboard.wikiedu.org assignment">dashboard.wikiedu.org assignment</a>}} box? That box would be the first place a regular editor learns about a student's involvement, so they should know where to go when issues need to be sorted. Also, this helps for early "regulars"–"students" communication (assuming the /Incidents page is not for internal Wiki Ed communication exclusively).</li>
</ol>
<p>All of this said, I will repeat what I said before: Wiki Ed is imho a great thing, that's why I think it is useful to take some time to hash out its issues. The program should give new editors some gusto for editing Wikipedia beyond their class assignment, which it currently only very rarely does: too often, currently, it ends in frustration, so let's do something about it. --<a href="/wiki/User:Francis_Schonken" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Francis_Schonken" title="User talk:Francis Schonken">talk</a>) 07:14, 16 March 2017 (UTC)</p>
<p>Still another thought:</p>
<ol>
<li value="6">In the introduction for Wiki Ed <i>instructors</i> it should maybe made clear that the professors/teachers should not primarily expect to test a student's ability to write an essay via Wikipedia (there are more appropriate venues for that, within their institution): what they are really testing in a Wiki Ed setup is the student's ability to work together with people they don't know, within their field of interest. Are they able to learn from that interaction? This is future-minded: the idea of a single scholar working in his study surrounded by books, undisturbed by the outside world, is overhauled in a wiki setting where there is immediate feedback: how do students cope with such feedback without getting sidetracked? ...seems more like the thing that is tested in a Wikipedia setup (hence my suggestion above to keep prospective mainspace content out of user talk namespace staying under the communication radar). Which entails instructors being instructed how to read edit histories and talk pages (how did the student react to input by others? what did they learn from it in their topic area? did they manage to stay on topic? did they learn something about assessing on-line and paper reference works in a <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">WP:RS</a> approach?). Seems like a setting that will gain momentum in future approaches to research, so today's students would do well to prepare for it (e.g. distinguishing <a href="/wiki/Fake_news" title="Fake news">fake news</a> from solid information based on source assessment &amp; input from others is a hot topic nowadays: better learn students cutting edge approaches on how to do that than learn them to write essays old style, which their schools and universities are surely better equipped for).</li>

<dd>Tx, the problem is, however, with the alternative interface not accepting feedback: i.e. it doesn't pass feedback on to the editor who accesses &amp; edits Wikipedia through the alternative interface, that is, <i>without logging in into Wikipedia</i>. In that sense the Dashboard operates as a bot, churning out dozens (hundreds? thousands?) of Wikipedia edits blindfoldedly. We wouldn't accept any bot to do that: the bot would be blocked immediately, until it accepts feedback from human Wikipedia editors. Imagine being able to edit Wikipedia with AWB, without being notified of pings, user talk page messages, or whatever initiates normal in-wikipedia communication... That wouldn't last long I suppose, even if you would only make an edit in this way every few days.</dd>
<dd>For me it makes no difference whether this is approached as a "go through BRFA to get approval for this functionality", or whether, alternatively, we block all external-Dashboard-generated edits to pages for which the Dashboard claims ownership, because it goes against <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:OWN" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:OWN">WP:OWN</a> to let it continue this behaviour. The first approach does however seem to have the advantage to offer a way out. The second approach is fairly simple and straightforward: Dashboard can't own a page in Wikipedia, thus exclude it from operations on Wikipedia. --<a href="/wiki/User:Francis_Schonken" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Francis_Schonken" title="User talk:Francis Schonken">talk</a>) 14:42, 16 March 2017 (UTC)

<dd>The dashboard only makes edits on behalf of logged-in users. You must log in to Wikipedia in order to log in to dashboard.wikiedu.org, and we expect instructors to be responsive to problems that come up related to their courses. If you run into trouble with an unresponsive instructor, you can ping a Wiki Ed staff member and/or post to <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:ENI" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:ENI">WP:ENI</a>. The 'owned' dashboard pages on Wikipedia are a convenience for other editors to easily connect the dots with active courses. It would be easy to change the system such that it only posted essentially an initial version, and then made no further edits (so that it would never overwrite changes in the meantime), but that would defeat much of the purpose; it would just mean that the on-wiki page would not include up-to-date information about which users are doing what, and what the instructor's latest assignment plan is. I think I'll make some updates to the edit notice (<a href="/wiki/Template:Editnotices/Group/Wikipedia:Wiki_Ed" title="Template:Editnotices/Group/Wikipedia:Wiki Ed">Template:Editnotices/Group/Wikipedia:Wiki Ed</a>) to make it more clear how to address problems (ie, contact the people involved rather than edit the automatically-updated course page).

The editors making edits without access to feedback are responsible for their edits (including responding to feedback, as necessary), and they could be blocked if a lack of response to feedback becomes disruptive.

<dd>The editors (who are brand new editors relying on experienced WikieEd instructors) should not be blocked for not giving response to feedback.

<dd>Yes and no: it is not my aim to get anyone blocked. Editors monitoring WikiEd processes, i.e. the ones with "(Wiki Ed)" in their username, are doing a great job. But, (1) they should seek permission if they want to override <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:OWN" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:OWN">WP:OWN</a> for specific pages, and (2) true, when they strive to get students and their educational instructors to get more engaged in wiki-interaction they might reflect that the way the Dashboard application is set up it rather works <i>against</i> such interaction, than that it supports such interaction. For these reasons I think it best that, unless the permission is obtained (which is in no way a case decided in advance), the Dashboard interface should be prevented to operate any edits to en.Wikipedia. --<a href="/wiki/User:Francis_Schonken" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Francis_Schonken" title="User talk:Francis Schonken">talk</a>) 07:43, 20 March 2017 (UTC)

<dd><span class="template-ping">@<a href="/wiki/User:Francis_Schonken" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a>:</span> This only addresses one of your points above, but regarding the course pages/WP:OWN issues, the on-wiki course pages (the ones starting with Wikipedia:Wiki Ed/) are on-wiki copies of Dashboard-based course pages. Neither Wiki Ed staff nor students nor instructors have cause to use the on-wiki copies. They exist because we heard from members of the community that it might be useful to have an on-wiki record, even if they would only be that -- a record. The way we can keep those on-wiki copies up-to-date is by having the Dashboard automatically update it. That means any manual changes would be overridden, yes, but there's not actually any reason to edit it because, again, it's only a record -- changing it would create a discrepancy between the on-wiki and Dashboard (primary) version and the people who you would want to leave a message for there would not receive the message there anyway (again, instructors/students/staff don't typically use the on-wiki course page). Personally, I like having the on-wiki record, if for no other reason than to have an internal link to include in the article talk page template, but it's ultimately up to the community and if it could feasibly be discontinued if there's consensus to do so.</dd>
<dd>Segueing to another point (though my response on this is somewhat redundant), although instructors/students aren't going to receive messages left on the on-wiki course pages, the Dashboard is only used for course organization/planning/management purposes, and all editing is done through traditional editing interfaces. So a student shouldn't be any less likely to see a message/notification than any other new user (more likely, in fact, because we regularly remind them to engage with the community on talk pages, check for messages, etc.). I'd be happy to talk more about these issues on my talk page (or elsewhere). --<a href="/wiki/User:Ryan_(Wiki_Ed)" title="User:Ryan (Wiki Ed)">Ryan (Wiki Ed)</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ryan_(Wiki_Ed)" title="User talk:Ryan (Wiki Ed)">talk</a>) 17:26, 21 March 2017 (UTC)

<dd>All of your explanations only confirm, in my eyes at least, that we should never have allowed edits to Wikipedia via the Dashboard interface.

<dd>I don't understand this question. Have you used the Dashboard? If not, I'd recommend setting up your own test class/program on the Programs and Events Dashboard (outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org). It's a fork of the Wiki Ed Dashboard for programs beyond classes, so it won't create those Wiki Ed course pages, but it will give you a feel for why this suggestion doesn't make sense to me. The Dashboard is a piece of software for classes editing Wikipedia. No editing is done through the Dashboard -- it's where students go through training, add their assigned articles, where instructors can see an overview of student work, etc. The on-wiki course page is a brief, static information page. There is no static page to edit in the Dashboard, and its pages are automatically updated based on student/instructor activity. In short, it would be impossible to work the other way, and that's part of the reason why the Dashboard exists in the first place. Again, if you find there is consensus for your view that the Dashboard should not create these static information pages, we can certainly stop the practice, but while I know of others who like having them there, I've not seen others object. --<a href="/wiki/User:Ryan_(Wiki_Ed)" title="User:Ryan (Wiki Ed)">Ryan (Wiki Ed)</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ryan_(Wiki_Ed)" title="User talk:Ryan (Wiki Ed)">talk</a>) 10:20, 22 March 2017 (UTC)

<dd>I take the perspective of a Wikipedia editor. Which is by definition <i>not</i> knowing how Dashboard works.

<dd>Also, this line of defence makes the prospect for ever obtaining a permission to overwrite Wikipedia project pages even bleaker: above a Wikipedia admin defended Dashboard-to-Wikipedia edits while "a single edit in the WikiEd interface leads to a single edit on Wikipedia". Seems from the last explanation given by a Wiki Ed editor that that is not the case, while in the Dashboard "pages are automatically updated based on student/instructor activity", and then the overwrite is generated, <i>blindfoldedly</i> as I suggested above, without seeing what one is overwriting on a Wikipedia page. Not an acceptable process. AFAICS there's only one possible course of action: disable that Dashboard functionality immediately until a permission is granted to override Wikipedia policies for the particular case (BTW: a Wikipedia page that gets regularly updated is not a "static" page). Yes, the Wikipedia project needs to be informed about goings-on in Wiki Ed course projects that are affecting or going to affect Wikipedia content, so that information will need to be given by manual edits, and not by automatic overwrites, until if and when the automatic procedure may be accepted by Wikipedia(ns). What is even more needed than periodic one-way information about the goings-on of particular Wiki Ed courses, is the possibility to have, per Wiki Ed course, a forum where the course setup can be discussed to avoid annoyance (both from the course to Wikipedia as from Wikipedia to the course). Such page should probably best be organised Wikipedia-side, but with more responsibility from Wiki Ed side (including its initiators, instructors and students) to interact on that Wikipedia page to address unresolved issues. --<a href="/wiki/User:Francis_Schonken" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Francis_Schonken" title="User talk:Francis Schonken">talk</a>) 11:36, 22 March 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As already discussed in my suggestion No.&#160;3 in the <a href="#Dashboard">previous section</a>, a quick fix for sound student-regular WP editor interaction would be to keep students out of their user space for drafting mainspace content. A violent (as opposed to sound) interaction is documented in progress <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Adam_(Wiki_Ed)#Speedy_Deletion_Nomination" title="User talk:Adam (Wiki Ed)">here</a>: a student's draft has been deleted from their user space, with admins quibbling (surely way over the newbie's head) whether the delete was opportune. That's not the welcome we want to give to newbie students, nor is this something where established Wikipedia editors (including admins) should devote that amount of time to. --<a href="/wiki/User:Francis_Schonken" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Francis_Schonken" title="User talk:Francis Schonken">talk</a>) 09:11, 22 March 2017 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is this a suggestion that new student editors <i>not</i> work in their sandboxes before editing articles? Part of the point of doing that (not just for students) is that content is <i>less</i> likely to be deleted from userspace while new users get a handle on editing... --<a href="/wiki/User:Ryan_(Wiki_Ed)" title="User:Ryan (Wiki Ed)">Ryan (Wiki Ed)</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ryan_(Wiki_Ed)" title="User talk:Ryan (Wiki Ed)">talk</a>) 10:22, 22 March 2017 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The main point is not the likeliness something can be deleted (this is a Wiki environment), but the soundness of the interaction. The in-progress example I linked to above illustrates a <i>deletion</i> under the cloud of a <i>frustrating</i> interaction. So snap out of the reasoning where "avoid deletion of whatever a student writes" is a goal in itself. If the student knows what they have to do better to make an edit stick, with admins addressing the needs of the student (instead of having a discussion over the student's head), then there is a useful interaction from which the student, Wikipedia and the Wiki Ed project benefit. --<a href="/wiki/User:Francis_Schonken" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Francis_Schonken" title="User talk:Francis Schonken">talk</a>) 10:50, 22 March 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I once used a public computer apparently used by someone called Jamenta, and now my anonymous edits--almost all connected to my expertise with William James on whom I have published many articles as well as a\n Academic Press book--are all being deleted--even from the talk page--based on this misidentification. See below. Please advise. And thank you.</p>
<p>"Unhelpful changes./* corrections */ Please explain why correcting grammar and adding a brief quote by a well respected knowledgable source is unhelpful."</p>
<p>"Because you have been banned from wikipedia on your account Jamenta for inserting fringe content on wikipedia, swearing and making legal threats."</p>
<p>"You have an obsession with quoting William James. He was a psychologist who was duped by paranormal claims yet you quote this guy like a religious script. He he is mentioned in the article, a long quote is undue to a fringe point of view."</p>
<p>"It is not a long quote. I shortened it once and am willing to make it even shorter. You are apparently unacquainted with James's full writings on parapsychology. He remained open-mined, unsure, and ultimately "baffled" by parapsychology. But whatever your personal opinion about James, it is not serving Wikipedia--a forum dedicated to balancing different opinions--well here. A minimum, specific reason of support by a well-respected authority on Myers specifically and parapsychology in general, is essential to match the many reasons opposed by other, far obscurer, and by no means better vetted, authorities."</p>

<p>I am looking to have the capacity to suggest edits based on my expertise. If the first step I need to take is to appeal this misidentification with Jamenta so that it never arises again I will begin that appeal.

<li>71.167.134.66 - Whether you are Jamenta or not, we cannot take your word for it that you are William James. You could go to <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:OTRS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:OTRS">WP:OTRS</a> and ask them how to go about providing them with the information they need to prove your identity, but (I'm not absolutely certain, but I think) you will probably need to create an account to do that, since we can't have the proven "William James" flitting about from one IP to another, that would set up a situation where just about any IP could say that they were William James. On the other hand, if anyone is really convinced that you are Jamenta, they can file a sockpuppet investigation report (SPI), and if admins decide the evidence is sufficient you can be blocked from editing, whether you have an account or not.

<li>Thank you for your time here. I can create a user name with my real name, but what is to keep my real name from being identified with this Jamenta person? Should I just disown the identity when I sign on, and make my appeals about it therefrom? One other concern: My sense is that NPOV is not always enforced when it comes to parapsychology. Can an Administrator override a trigger happy editor like Mr. Macon here. Can a pile-on of obscure critics really not be answered by one well-sourced renowned critic? If you find my changes serve the interest of fair play can you revert them now? That would be encouraging. There is little point in my continuing to try to balance out a pile of negative references with one positive reference if it will always be reverted by those, like Mr. Macon and company, who apparently does not believe parapsychology deserves a NPOV.<a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/71.167.134.66" title="Special:Contributions/71.167.134.66">71.167.134.66</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:71.167.134.66&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:71.167.134.66 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 02:50, 17 March 2017 (UTC)</li>

<p>Understood. Would very much appreciate hearing from the Administrator community whether they think Mr. Macon's deleting my sourced James review of Myers Phantasms of the Living in the 2 Wikipedia articles it appears in, an insertion I made to balance out the pile-on of obscure detractors, was in keeping with "representing fairly, proportionately, and, as far as possible, without editorial bias, all of the significant views that have been published by reliable sources on a topic."<a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/71.167.134.66" title="Special:Contributions/71.167.134.66">71.167.134.66</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:71.167.134.66&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:71.167.134.66 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 11:36, 17 March 2017 (UTC)</p>

<li>It is aslo likely this user has other sockpuppets on the Myers article. My conclusion is that this user is Jamenta or at a minimum associated with that individual. In his defense his wrote that over 800 people worked in the building he was working at on his own IP, but really? Two people have the exact same interest in James and Myers and moan about "sceptic bias"? Whoever this person is, he is not honest. I am all for letting people use wikipedia who make constructive edits and giving people a second chance, but this user is nothing more than a pseudoscience promoter. He fails to understand wikipedia policies on fringe material, he seems to think over a hundred years old opinions from credulous paranormal believers like Myers are reliable sources of information. He has no decent edits, not here to build an encyclopedia all he wants to do is push fringe content. He will never give up doing this, every edit he will make will be controversial and just stir up repeated arguments like he has done before. He is now stirring on another noticeboard. I think it would be best if this guy Jamenta was blocked. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/82.132.242.74" title="Special:Contributions/82.132.242.74">82.132.242.74</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:82.132.242.74&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:82.132.242.74 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 21:11, 17 March 2017 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have to concur with 82 above. All those IPs are Jamenta or closely related somehow. I've never seen anyone else with the obsession for James and Myers and the willingness to try to argue that "evidence" over a century old outweighs more current sources. Does this have to go to SPI or can an admin just DUCK block these accounts? I'm not sure how viable a range block is. Maybe protect the effected articles for a bit? <a href="/wiki/User:Capeo" title="User:Capeo">Capeo</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Capeo" title="User talk:Capeo">talk</a>) 22:03, 17 March 2017 (UTC)

<p>I am not Jamenta. I have no idea what a sock pocket is. I am a recognized James scholar and will sign on with my own name if that is the only way to pursue this false accusation. But there is little point in my trying to edit for fairness in my area of expertise--using James, where appropriate, to balance pile-ups of obscure and sometimes questionable authorities--if the Administrators will not support my efforts. I think it is essential to make the distinction between promoting parapsychology per se and promoting a fair and balance point of view toward historical figures and events that are part of its history. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/71.167.134.66" title="Special:Contributions/71.167.134.66">71.167.134.66</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:71.167.134.66&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:71.167.134.66 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 03:05, 18 March 2017 (UTC)</p>

<li>It looks to me like someone purposely changing his writing style in an attempt to get away with block evasion. I won't reveal all of the things I noticed (no point tutoring him on how to evade his block) but I will point out one: What are the chances that someone who writes "I have no idea what a sock pocket is" would also also write "I once used a public computer apparently used by someone called Jamenta" and "The reason I did not fight the misconception when it arose was because it was a public computer and I did not want to involve the company"? On the one hand, he implies that he has never read <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:SOCK" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>, yet on the other, he is making excuses for using the same IP as Jamenta before anyone here has identified the two as posting from the same IP (While doing that 71.167.134.66 inadvertently revealed that he has also posted as 208.194.97.5 <a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:208.194.97.5&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=721584396">[10]</a>.

So he knows that checkuser exists but doesn't know what a sockpuppet is? What he didn't realize is that most admins are not checkusers and that those who are checkusers won't reveal or even check Jamenta's IP against any IP editor -- blocked editors still have full privacy right on Wikipedia, and linking a username to an IP address is a serious breach of those rights. --<a href="/wiki/User:Guy_Macon" title="User:Guy Macon">Guy Macon</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Guy_Macon" title="User talk:Guy Macon">talk</a>) 19:04, 18 March 2017 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have learned my lesson about the perils of not creating an account. I will open one later this month. If anyone follows through the work I have tried to do so far (again I am not now nor ever have been Jamenta), I believe it will be evident that my sole purpose has been to balance historical articles that are overloaded with negative responses to anything dealing with parapsychology. None of the articles I have worked on bear any resemblance to Wikipedia's noble aspirations for what an article should be. If Wikipedia decided to banish all articles dealing with parapsychology (like the New York Times pretty much now does) I would be ok with that. But once an article is allowed, it cannot just hang there as a target for darts.<a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/71.167.134.66" title="Special:Contributions/71.167.134.66">71.167.134.66</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:71.167.134.66&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:71.167.134.66 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 08:09, 20 March 2017 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, I can see your point about double agreeing. I believed, perhaps erroneously, that I needed to respond to Aspro Talk's "No Response." I am still responding here now with my IP because I launched this thread, "Unable to edit because of misidentification with a blocked user," as such and thought I needed to maintain that same identity throughout. The exact same reasoning applies to why I maintained my IP on the WP:NPOVN site that an Editor here kindly referred me to. But then, you have even blocked my responses to those who responded to me there. The responses I was given were worthy of responses, which I gave. I would like to hear from an Administrator how those responses can be restored. Again, I thought it would be confusing to switch identities midstream. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/71.167.134.66" title="Special:Contributions/71.167.134.66">71.167.134.66</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:71.167.134.66&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:71.167.134.66 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 14:46, 21 March 2017 (UTC).<a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/71.167.134.66" title="Special:Contributions/71.167.134.66">71.167.134.66</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:71.167.134.66&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:71.167.134.66 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 15:10, 21 March 2017 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you, Guy. I will this week. I assume no one has an objection to my initially registering an account with an anonymous name, such as "Spirit of James"?

<dd><small>(<span style="color:#555;">Non-administrator comment</span>)</small> Hi 71.167.134.66. You can use your real name if you like, but you might want to take a look at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:REALNAME" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:REALNAME">WP:REALNAME</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:WRW" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:WRW">WP:WRW</a> first. As Guy Macon pointed out, it's the quality of your edits, not your choice of username, which really matters the most . On Wikipedia, your choice of username may only turn out to be a problem if (1) it does not comply with <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:UN" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:UN">WP:UN</a> and (2) it gives others the impression that you have a <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:APPARENTCOI" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:APPARENTCOI">conflict of interest</a> when it comes to certain Wikipedia articles. However, off Wikipedia harassment can be an issue which is a possibility you might want to take into account if by chance you are a fairly well-known person. Remember that your <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:UCP" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:UCP">user contributions</a> are pretty much there for anyone to see and try to use in a manner which might not be appropriate.</dd>
<dd>As for focused editing, there's nothing wrong per se with being a <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:SPA" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:SPA">WP:SPA</a>. However, limiting your focus to a single article or genre of articles might also limit your ability to better understand collaborative editing and how various policies and guidelines are applied on a community-wide basis. Moreover, being an SPA is not considered a good reason for not editing in accordance with these policies and guidelines. Being an "<a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:EXPERT" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:EXPERT">expert</a>" with respect to a particular field may help you improve the quality of certain articles, but it does not grant you any special status; you will still be expected to edit according to relevant policies and guidelines. There are a number of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:WPPJ" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:WPPJ">WikiProjects</a> where editors of similar interests work together on improving certain areas of the encyclopedia.

<p>Thank you both for these helpful tips. Obviously I anticipate more harassment for my decidedly SPA focus on NPOV balance for historical articles related to James's world--which involves a subject, parapsychology, that some Editors have openly expressed complete contempt for. I will continue to be accused of violating the SPA ban of "appear[ing] to edit for the purposes of promotion or showcasing their favored point of view," when I am trying to use my area of expertise to undo what I see as violations of same. My sole interest is in correcting obvious historical errors and distortions using respectable sources. If I use the name, "Spirit of James," some Editors who have already publicly equated an openminded approach to parapsychology (as James had) to an openminded approach to flat earth theories, will surely feel provoked and especially motivated to counter my edits. They would deny James as a respectable source for the same reason that they would deny anyone who promoted flat earth theories as a respectable source. I have already been told this explicitly on the WP: NPOVN site. But of course, as I pointed out (soon to be unblocked), there are no respectable sources--let alone esteemed scientists, Noble laureates, etc. as there are for parapsychology--who are openminded about flat earth theories. Not one. Yet I anticipate Editors will continue to see my edits as a provocation to promote their "favored point of view" that any source that advocates an openminded approach toward parapsychology, automatically qualifies as an unreliable source. Nonetheless, I still think it best to have my SPA out front, registering as "Spirit of James," by which I am referring only to his openminded spirit toward parapsychology, however much it may be misinterpreted as referring to his solid conviction in parapsychology--a conviction he explicitly stated he did not have. But if any Administrator feels this username is ill advised, please let me hear from you.<a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/71.167.134.66" title="Special:Contributions/71.167.134.66">71.167.134.66</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:71.167.134.66&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:71.167.134.66 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 13:41, 22 March 2017 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The following has been explained to you multiple times:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Arguing about article content at ANI, as you just did (again), is inappropriate behavior. Administrators do not make decisions on content, only on user behavior.</li>
<li>Arguing that you are not a sockpuppet on pages <i>other</i> than ANI is inappropriate behavior. Article talk pages are for discussing improvements to the article. The reliable source noticeboard is for taking about the reliability of specific sources for specific uses.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>I would add the following; now that you have agreed to start using a username as a condition of not being blocked, in my opinion, a reasonable number of questions posted to ANI or the help desk about what username to choose seems reasonable to me. I am not an administrator (I have turned down multiple offers to be nominated) but I have been here over ten years, and I don't see any problem with the username "Spirit of James". I also don't see any problem if you end up making the same arguments Jamenta made. We all agreed (see above) that, if you start editing with a username, we will all assume that you are not a sockpuppet trying to evade a block, no matter what our personal opinions on that are. I would, however, caution you to avoid making the same arguments Jamenta made <i>and doing the same things that got Jamenta blocked.'</i> There is some good advice about this at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Clean_start" title="Wikipedia:Clean start">Wikipedia:Clean start</a>, and I would also recommend my essay at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:1AM" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:1AM">WP:1AM</a>. --<a href="/wiki/User:Guy_Macon" title="User:Guy Macon">Guy Macon</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Guy_Macon" title="User talk:Guy Macon">talk</a>) 20:16, 22 March 2017 (UTC)</dd>

Thank you, Guy. But again, I have no idea who Jamenta is or what he said. So as long as no one mixes us up again, as my own account will apparently assure, I don't see how clean start is relevant. Our styles, apparently, are completely different, as an Administrator here has already noted. I have not been, nor ever intend to be, abusive. I am sorry you think I had a specific article content post just now. It was very much directed at past and anticipated future User behavior as applies to SPA, and whether using my proposed name would be overly provocative. But I very much appreciate that although you are not an Administrator you have weighed in favorably on it. Pending no Administrator caveat, I will go with it.

<dd>This was raised at ANEW by a pop-up disposable IP account, and concluded with 1 day and a 3 month blocks for two parties in trivial and fairly symmetrical edit-warring (Yes the edit-warring is real, I don't dispute that). I cannot see that such an unbalanced conclusion is at all appropriate, whatever the track record of the editors. I am particularly concerned at how it was raised!

<li>I suppose if anyone goes to WV's talk page to investigate, they'll see there are at least 6 admins who <b>already</b> support an unblock with an <i>indefinite 1RR restriction</i>, which I'm planning to enact on Monday, if no one has done it before then. Coffee opposes that and so brought it here. There was some vague accusation that WV was adminshopping before this was brought here, so it's worth pointing out that among the admins supporting this are an unpinged admin who has previously blocked him for a month (me), an unpinged admin who has previously declined a more lenient unblock request (LB), <s>an unpinged</s> a pinged <small>(sorry, my mistake, she was pinged)</small> admin who, I believe, has previously issued WV a topic ban (Bish), and another unpinged admin (Ritchie). None of the admins who <i>were</i> pinged by WV are supporting a straight unblock, and none of them have reputations for shady behavior or favoritism. It seems to me that 6 admins all agreeing on a course of action for an unblock, and only the blocking admin opposed, is pretty close to as good a definition of consensus as you're going to get around here. --<a href="/wiki/User:Floquenbeam" title="User:Floquenbeam">Floquenbeam</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Floquenbeam" title="User talk:Floquenbeam">talk</a>) 21:23, 17 March 2017 (UTC)</li>

Swarm unblocked with a rationale of <i>Sock involvement demonstrated post-block, edits exempted from 3RR</i> (i.e. <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:3RRNO" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:3RRNO">WP:3RRNO</a>), while I unblocked and then left a comment of <i>Winkelvi was in the middle of discussing the situation; I wouldn't have blocked if I had seen this</i>. I'd say you should count this as four EW-related blocks. Whether or not four-versus-five-versus-six should affect anyone's vote or anyone's contribution to this discussion I won't say; I just hope that people consider the entire block log and not just the blocks themselves. In particular, don't count all of the <i>[admin] blocked Winkelvi</i> lines, since at least my second block of him (the one-second block) was done just to add an apology to the block log; I'm thankful that nobody, so far, has carelessly just counted the number of lines. <a href="/wiki/User:Nyttend" title="User:Nyttend">Nyttend</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Nyttend" title="User talk:Nyttend">talk</a>) 23:25, 17 March 2017 (UTC)

<li>The reason for the included number is the pattern of behavior itself.

<dd>Yes, perhaps the block log and blocking admins' comments deserve closer scrutiny.

Your behavior is nearly constantly disruptive. You do it even when warned, except apparently you think as long as the disruption is with some <i>other</i> person it is OK. Every single time you are blocked you say you've seen the light and will change, you never do.

<dd>Its worth noting that in the last year they have also been blocked for deliberate harrassment of another editor and 'feuding' with other editors. Both conduct issues.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I think 0RR may be justified here, given that WV's default mode is complete entrenchment in a given position without willingness to <i>really</i> listen or discuss -- as exemplified by Neutrality's example. This kind of behavior would be expected of a newbie, but it is unacceptable for someone who has been here 5 years and made 25,000 edits, and there has been no indication of any longterm change.

<li>I've seen plenty of Winkelvi, and he of me. This edit warring is an unfortunate habit. The talk page discussion is so long that I can't even tell if he really <i>got</i> it--that this was a violation and a blockable one. Can any of you tell me if he posted that he gets it? Anyway, I supported, or maybe even proposed! an unblock with a 1R condition for three months--I'll settle for anything that resembles that, and if there's a majority for 0R, I suppose I'm OK with that too.
<p><a href="/wiki/User:Softlavender" title="User:Softlavender">Softlavender</a>, I hear you--I think Winkelvi is one of those editors that just can't help himself when given the latitude editors think 3R give them. I don't want to be the psychoanalyst here or anywhere else, but that's what I think, and I think we have quite a number of those editors, most of whom function quite well though sometimes with restrictions, and you understand I'm not naming names here. His edits, as far as I remember, aren't <i>tendentious</i>; sometimes they're just...persistent. That's not good either, but it's not irredeemable. He's no POV warrior, for instance.

<li><b>Support indefinite 1RR regardless of unblock</b> and <b>neutral, leaning support on unblock</b> Frankly, I think the project would be better off if <i>everyone</i> was subject to 1RR except in cases of obvious vandalism, etc. The 3RR principle, that everyone is allowed edit-war up to a certain point, runs counter to AGF, since we should be assuming as soon as we are reverted once that the reverter is acting in good faith. 3RR also places an arbitrary numeric value on what counts as an edit war, and so encourages gaming of the system by users who don't engage in talk page discussion but edit carefully to make it look like they do. The only exception I can think of is where the reverter's edit summary made it clear that they had, in good faith, misunderstood your original edit.<a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_Pie_(song)&amp;diff=767341429&amp;oldid=767315471">[24]</a> So yeah, I would probably support an unblock and indefinite 1RR for just about anyone, but given the repeated nature of this offense, and especially that the last block was repealed with a 3-month 1RR restriction I am a bit more ambivalent on an immediate unblock, and can't see how anyone could oppose the 1RR restriction regardless of whether they agree with my personal philosophy. (Full disclosure: ArbCom subjected me to 1RR in late 2015 for some edit-warring that had happened in early 2015. I had immediately regretted said edit-warring and happily accepted the 1RR restriction.

<li><small>Don't mention it. Honestly the disclosure was more of an afterthought.

<li>It seems to me we should note all of the admins that Winkelvi has been ping-canvassing from his talk page <a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Winkelvi&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=770692355">[27]</a>, <a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Winkelvi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=770850267">[28]</a>: <span class="plainlinks"><a class="external text" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:MelanieN">MelanieN</a></span>, <span class="plainlinks"><a class="external text" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Diannaa">Diannaa</a></span>, <span class="plainlinks"><a class="external text" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a></span>, <span class="plainlinks"><a class="external text" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JamesBWatson">JamesBWatson</a></span>, <span class="plainlinks"><a class="external text" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Anna_Frodesiak">Anna Frodesiak</a></span>, <span class="plainlinks"><a class="external text" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Drmies">Drmies</a></span>, <span class="plainlinks"><a class="external text" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Bbb23">Bbb23</a></span>, <span class="plainlinks"><a class="external text" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Laser_brain">Laser brain</a></span>, <span class="plainlinks"><a class="external text" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:NeilN">NeilN</a></span>, <span class="plainlinks"><a class="external text" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ponyo">Ponyo</a></span>, <span class="plainlinks"><a class="external text" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ritchie333">Ritchie333</a></span>, <span class="plainlinks"><a class="external text" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Floquenbeam">Floquenbeam</a></span>. (Those are "nopings" on my end.) Although I think Coffee is being a bit aggressive in his insistence not to accede to the other admin opinions on WV's talkpage, those admins were all canvassed except Floquenbeam and Laserbrain, whereas it is the community at large who bears the brunt of WV's behavior, and therefore the community should probably have a voice in this matter, given the very long history, in my opinion. <a href="/wiki/User:Softlavender" title="User:Softlavender">Softlavender</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Softlavender" title="User talk:Softlavender">talk</a>) 03:33, 18 March 2017 (UTC)

<li>That is quite in fact why I brought this here. I don't have enough energy to try to discuss this matter with that many people all at once (by myself), and it is my personal opinion that these admins do not a consensus make. I believe firmly in the community's ability to decide what is best in matters like this, and as such have deferred this matter to you all. Laser brain declined the original unblock request and another formal one was not made, WV instead decided to use a system of pings to get unblocked. Obviously, I have grave concern for such a system... and <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:ADMINSHOP" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:ADMINSHOP">WP:ADMINSHOP</a> shows that our community does as well. <small style="color:#999;white-space:nowrap;text-shadow:lightgrey 0.3em 0.3em 0.15em;">— <a href="/wiki/User:Coffee" title="User:Coffee"><big style="color:#ffa439">Coffee</big></a> // <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Coffee" title="User talk:Coffee"><font color="#009900">have a cup</font></a> // <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Coffee" title="Special:Contributions/Coffee"><font color="#4682B4">beans</font></a> //</small> 03:51, 18 March 2017 (UTC)UTC)

<li>Huh. I'm normally inclined to agree with Drmies in cases like this, but <u>I don't here, as that definitely looks like canvassing.</u> I've never quite understood why something can only be called "canvassing" if the users were specifically contacted on their talk pages, especially in cases like this where that is impossible and pinging on one's own talk page is all one can do. That's <i>way too many people</i> for Winkelvi to be pinging. The fact that all or at least most of them are respectable Wikipedians who aren't likely to come to his aid just because he canvassed them doesn't change the fact that he did canvass them. <a href="/wiki/User:Hijiri88" title="User:Hijiri88">Hijiri 88</a> (<small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Hijiri88" title="User talk:Hijiri88">聖</a><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Hijiri88" title="Special:Contributions/Hijiri88">やや</a></small>) 04:08, 18 March 2017 (UTC) (edited 04:29, 18 March 2017 (UTC))

<li><a href="/wiki/User:Hijiri88" title="User:Hijiri88">Hijiri88</a>, I don't think Winkelvi can expect me to agree or jump to his defense if the position is indefensible--in this case, the block itself was justified and I said so.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I was curious about <span class="plainlinks"><a class="external text" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Coretheapple">Coretheapple</a></span>'s mention above of his "nightmare" encounter with Winkelvi on <a href="/wiki/Bess_Myerson" title="Bess Myerson">Bess Myerson</a> two years ago and checked that out. It does indeed seem to have been a nightmare, and in my opinion is representative of Winkelvi's inability to, and refusal to, brook disagreement. He appears incapable of letting go. Winkelvi arrived at the article here: <a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bess_Myerson&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=641187770&amp;oldid=641186447">[31]</a>, and made 120 edits to it in 2.5 days, including massively, heedlessly, endlessly, and obstinately edit-warring with <a href="/wiki/User:Coretheapple" title="User:Coretheapple">Coretheapple</a> and <a href="/wiki/User:Alanscottwalker" title="User:Alanscottwalker">Alanscottwalker</a> (edit-warring begins here: <a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bess_Myerson&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=641279541">[32]</a>, clicking "Next edit" from there on out is quite instructional). This resulted in Winkelvi being reported at ANEW <a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Edit_warring&amp;oldid=641636369#User:Winkelvi_reported_by_User:Coretheapple_.28Result:_Protected.29">[33]</a> and the article being locked for a week, at which time Winkelvi left the article completely. Not however before covering the article talk page with endless IDHT walls of text <a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bess_Myerson">[34]</a> (from top to bottom of that talk page, 79 edits and tens of thousands of bytes in 6 days: <a class="external autonumber" href="https://tools.wmflabs.org/sigma/usersearch.py?name=Winkelvi&amp;page=Talk%3ABess_Myerson&amp;max=500&amp;server=enwiki">[35]</a>) and leaving behind two very frustrated, be-numbed, bewildered, and resentful editors. If Winkelvi is unable to edit collaboratively, and needs outside intervention on such a regular basis, this is a real problem and needs a major solution.
<p>I'd also like to state that, for the record, I don't know how long it has been going on, but Floq and Coffee have an obvious feud going on (I noticed this in re: the TRM AE discussions), and so Floq should not be implementing any change here in my opinion. And also for the record, Winkelvi knows very well which admins he can curry leniency from, from having interacted with them in the past, and several of those were indeed the admins he pinged in his first round of pings, so the discussions on his talkpage should not be seen as binding or representative, in my opinion. <a href="/wiki/User:Softlavender" title="User:Softlavender">Softlavender</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Softlavender" title="User talk:Softlavender">talk</a>) 08:33, 18 March 2017 (UTC)</p>

<li><a href="/wiki/User:Softlavender" title="User:Softlavender">Softlavender</a> is correct in every respect. One of the most frustrating things about Winkelvi is not just his serial edit-warring and cluelessness, but his ability to game the system, finding admins he can coax into giving him "just a second chance" or a third chance or a fourth chance. I don't know if this was a factor in the recent hostilities, but he also claimed to have a medical condition that somehow contributed to or "explained" his edit-warring and tendentious conduct. His lengthy block record only hints at the burden he is to the project, as he is constantly being dragged before this or that drama board. <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=Winkelvi&amp;prefix=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27+noticeboard&amp;fulltext=Search&amp;fulltext=Search&amp;searchToken=b90q0d9wpreke6wu17u51p3pl">Search the drama boards</a> and you can see for yourself. <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive865#Winkelvi">Here is one</a>, an encounter with <a href="/wiki/User:Tenebrae" title="User:Tenebrae">User:Tenebrae</a> from 2014 that I just picked at random. Read that. No action. It just goes on and on and on, and he keeps on getting a pass until finally he gets blocked. Personally I am surprised that he has not been indeffed by now, but he always seems to find yet another sympathetic admin to give him yet another second chance, so that he can return to his old ways until he gets yet another second chance. <a href="/wiki/User:Coretheapple" title="User:Coretheapple">Coretheapple</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Coretheapple" title="User talk:Coretheapple">talk</a>) 15:10, 18 March 2017 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Give them the choice, stay blocked 3 months or agree to 6-month-to-1-year 1RR as unblock condition</b> — While 3 months reflexively seemed a bit much when I first stumbled across it (but then checked the block history and totally understood why), it's also a strong incentive to agree to an unblock condition of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:1RR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:1RR">WP:1RR</a>. To be perfectly clear, his revert history at <a href="/wiki/Billy_the_Kid" title="Billy the Kid">Billy the Kid</a> <i>clearly and obviously</i> violated <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:3RR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:3RR">WP:3RR</a>, and is doubly damning considering he's reported <i>other</i> people on AN3 before (I actually patrolled one of the reports the other day). What's worse is the fact that he was unable to acknowledge his error directly after the block, disputing the technicalities of what constitutes a revert—and to be clear, he's wrong. This shows a fundamental lack of understanding of 3RR, as well as the concept of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:EW" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:EW">WP:EW</a> as a whole. This, first and foremost, needs to be rectified. I've always been a fan of imposing 1RR over blocking when possible, and on a completely tangential note, it might be a good idea to start an RFC to allow admins to unilaterally impose 1RR restrictions on an editor (without needing an <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:ACDS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:ACDS">WP:ACDS</a>) in place of, and for durations proportionate to, normal blocks (subject to same appeals process as blocks). This would have been a prime case where an immediate 1RR restriction could have saved everyone a bunch of time and would have been pretty obviously supported. --<a href="/wiki/User:Slakr" title="User:Slakr"><span style="color:teal;font-weight:bold;">slakr</span></a><small><sup>\&#160;<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Slakr" title="User talk:Slakr">talk</a>&#160;/</sup></small> 09:36, 18 March 2017 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Comment: The thing about imposing 1RR instead of blocking, without community discussion, is that nobody knows that the 1RR exists except the people who happened to be watching the user's talk page at that time. So the user can freely violate 1RR and nobody knows and they do not get reported. That's why drawing the community's attention to the discussion and also allowing input and buy-in into sanctions other than blocks is very important. (And it's not the case that Winkelvi does not understand 3RR -- he has reported or been reported at ANEW at least 75 times -- see my and others' posts above.) <a href="/wiki/User:Softlavender" title="User:Softlavender">Softlavender</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Softlavender" title="User talk:Softlavender">talk</a>) 10:06, 18 March 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Support indefinite block</b>-I stumbled across this discussion and decided to give my opinion. I've interacted with Winkelvi a few times, most notably at Billy the Kid in early 2016. This was the first GAN that I reviewed, and I committed a few embarrassing mistakes, for which I take responsibility. But what I saw from Winkelvi was a persistent battleground attitude that included not only edit-warring but persistent hostility, questioning of motives, <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Ownership" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Ownership">WP:Ownership</a>, and vindictive behavior towards anyone disagreeing with him. By examining the history of his block log and the talk page and AN/I discussions concerning him that have taken place since then, I have found no reason to believe that he will change anything. Perhaps the biggest mistake that I made at that article was not failing it immediately after the edit war, which was largely out of guilt for originally passing it prematurely. What ensued after that was also a sort of nightmare, aided somewhat by my lack of knowledge on GA reviews and occasional immaturity, but rooted largely in Winkelvi's near-constant battleground attitude which alienated most of those who worked on the article.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>On his talk page, pinging Drmies, Winkelvi said that he "gets it." He has a history of saying that sort of thing after a block, but then somehow we always end up at the same place as before. A 1RR has been put in place before. Now he is back to the same type of behavior, so it's time to take it up a notch. But even a 0RR would still result in Winkelvi being able to continue his accusatory, battleground, and non-AGF behavior on talk pages. He may even resort to doing that more often, knowing that if he reverts and is caught it would likely result in a longer or indefinite block. What I saw on the Beth Myerson talk page is disturbing, and we could see more of that sort of talk page drama if Winkelvi knows that he can't revert anymore. That's why 1RR and even a 0RR won't work well enough. It also doesn't help that I find Winkelvi's excuses about not knowing the technicalities of 3RR to be totally unconvincing, considering his experience, history of edit-warring, and history of reporting other users for edit-warring. I'm not buying it.</dd>

<dd>Winkelvi has been given plenty of chances. He has thrown away all of them and in the process has caused the WP community an enormous amount of time and anguish.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I wasn't going to comment here, but in view of a couple of comments above, I will. <a href="/wiki/User:Coretheapple" title="User:Coretheapple">User:Coretheapple</a>, Winkelvi has had the aspergers userbox on his page for as long as I've known him, and your "he also claimed to have a medical condition that somehow contributed to or "explained" bla bla", is shameful, as if it was a new thing and most likely something he made up. "Medical condition", bah. You will answer me if you wish, naturally, but I have no more to say to you. <span class="template-ping">@<a href="/wiki/User:Softlavender" title="User:Softlavender">Softlavender</a>:</span>, when you say if there isn't an ANI discussion, "the user can freely violate 1RR and nobody knows and they do not get reported", you're assuming bad faith in a way that'll be like a knife to Winkelvi. He's on the autism spectrum, as he points out himself every now and then — it's no sort of secret — which colours his interactions with others. I understand that Wikipedia is not therapy, and I have certainly seen him behaving atrociously on talkpages. But he's actually big with rules, and I don't for a moment believe he'd violate a personal, specific sanction "freely" just because "nobody knows". Please compare the section "About me and editing" on his userpage, where he says among other things "Because those of us on the Spectrum are unfailingly "rule-followers", we are also honest to a fault. When we are accused of lying or intentionally being disruptive or not <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:AGF" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:AGF">acting in good faith</a>, it's quite hurtful." I've found that to be very true, both parts of it: Winkelvi follows rules, as long as they're very, very exact and spelled-out rules, and he's dreadfully distressed if he's accused of shady dealing. (Compare his reaction to <a href="/wiki/User:Coffee" title="User:Coffee">Coffee</a> in the first discussion, right under the block notice, and btw I think <a href="/wiki/User:Ritchie333" title="User:Ritchie333">Ritchie333</a>'s comment on that discussion was excellent: <span class="inline-quote-talk" style="font-family: Georgia, 'DejaVu Serif', serif; color: #008560;">"... when I block somebody I generally punt any conversations about the block off to reviewing administrators... picking a fight with an editor you block is generally counter-productive."</span> How I wish Coffee had worn his listening ears for that.) Also, never mind the autism spectrum, which people obviously aren't obliged to know about, it's a nasty thing to imply about anybody, that they'd cheerfully violate a restriction they had agreed to. That's what <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:AGF" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:AGF">WP:AGF</a> is for: because we know so little about anybody on the internet that we're commenting on.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>While I'm here: I've advocated unblock + indefinite 1RR on Winkelvi's talkpage, but I won't record any sort of bolded&#160;!vote here, because I'm not sure about the unblock. That's because Winkelvi does behave badly sometimes even apart from of edit warring, and I can certainly sympathise with the people who have experienced a "nightmare" interacting with him. That's far from something I'd wave away. But I do want to say, please don't <i>unblock on condition of 0RR</i>. One of Winkelvi's latest comment on his page, <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Winkelvi&amp;diff=770850267&amp;oldid=770849705">here</a> is rather convoluted, which of course doesn't serve him well, but the takeaway from it is that, while he's fine with 1RR, he hates the idea of 0RR so much that he'd rather ride out his 3-month block. So please, people, don't do that; either keep him blocked, or give him an indefinite <i>1RR</i> restriction. (On balance, I believe the 1RR restriction would be more helpful going forward than the block, but I think both are acceptable.) <a href="/wiki/User:Bishonen" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Bishonen" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 16:52, 18 March 2017 (UTC).

<dd>Oh please. You're acting as if he just has a userbox and that was that. How dare I mention that! What you didn't mention was that when he was doing his number in the Myerson article, and in other of his many disputes then and afterwards. he <s>was constantly "playing the Asperger's card," citing that alleged condition as an excuse for his actions. Yes, it is a claim, no it is not verifiable, yes, it is irrelevant, and yes, it is one of the many ways he gamed the system.</s> was claiming that he Asperger's is the cause of his conduct. He has <i>two entire sections</i> on his user page devoted to describing how his Asperger's is the cause of his conduct, and he has brought it up in defense of his actions. In <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Winkelvi&amp;oldid=639432746#Casting_aspersions">this exchange with Jehochman</a> he said "I'm not clueless, I have Asperger Syndrome (as is broadcast at the top of this page). People with Aspergers are generally quite intelligent with high-IQs. So, no, not clueless, just asking for specifics (something Aspies need at times to understand what someone is referring to vaguely)." The "broadcast at top of this page" comment refers to the fact that he has a notice at the top of his talk page referring to his Aspberger's "If you've had any kind of issue or misunderstanding in your dealings with me," So no, it is absolutely not just a user box. <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:High-functioning_autism_and_Asperger%27s_editors#Dealing_with_it_in_the_WikiWorld" title="Wikipedia:High-functioning autism and Asperger's editors">"People on the autism spectrum need to be aware that pulling the 'Oh, but I'm a poor misunderstood Aspie/Autie' card out of the pack is a bad move!

<dd><a href="/wiki/User:Bishonen" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a>, thank you for your message, but I'd like to point out a view things that I object to in your comment. You say <span class="inline-quote-talk" style="font-family: Georgia, 'DejaVu Serif', serif; color: #008560;">"Winkelvi follows rules, as long as they're very, very exact and spelled-out rules."</span> Um, no. The 6 blocks for edit-warring (not counting the one with sockpuppetry) show that this isn't the case. Take a look at this quote from <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:3rr" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:3rr">WP:3rr</a>:</dd>
<dd>"An editor must not perform more than three reverts on a single page—whether involving the same or different material—within a 24-hour period."</dd>
<dd>That seems pretty exact and spelled-out to me.</dd>
<dd>That's also not to mention the constant disruption that Winkelvi has caused on talk pages and drama boards during his <s>3+</s> [5] years contributing to Wikipedia. In a previous block, resulting from a long-term feud with another editor, an editor (possibly Floq, but I'm not entirely sure) called attention to the fact that Winkelvi seems to think that it is acceptable to, after being warned against feuding with one editor, to instead feud with another one, or (this may be from someone else) to "regularly change [his] mode of disruption." That's not Autism. That's called gaming the system by pretending to be clueless so that people will take pity on you and keep giving you chances. <a href="/wiki/User:Display_name_99" title="User:Display name 99">Display name 99</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Display_name_99" title="User talk:Display name 99">talk</a>) 17:10, 18 March 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> There are two main concerns expressed by the editors above - edit warring and talk page bludgeoning. 1RR is the obvious solution to the first concern but I foresee two problems. First, according to the "rules", Winkelvi can revert once a day on an article ad infinitum. Second, this allows anon IPs to troll Winkelvi as they have done in the past. For the talk page issue, I would suggest he be limited to one post a day but that may lead to walloftext posts. What is really needed is a mentor that Winkelvi has to go to whenever he runs into a conflict. However that could potentially be quite a demanding job and I don't know if anyone would volunteer to take it on. --<a href="/wiki/User:NeilN" title="User:NeilN"><b style="color:navy">Neil<span style="color:red">N</span></b></a> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:NeilN" title="User talk:NeilN"><i style="color:blue">talk to me</i></a></sup> 17:21, 18 March 2017 (UTC)</li>

And I think we can disagree with, for instance, Bishonen's assessment without being rude. Winkelvi broke policy; the block was justified. Coffee blocked and others disagreed; that's fine, that's what we're here for. Discuss it without criticizing the blockee, the blocker, the hypothetical unblocker, the proponents of more blocking, etc. Keep it civil please. <a href="/wiki/User:Drmies" title="User:Drmies">Drmies</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Drmies" title="User talk:Drmies">talk</a>) 18:26, 18 March 2017 (UTC)</li>

Anyway, I strongly <b>strongly</b> endorse this latest block because this is the sixth time he's been blocked for this same offense.

<li><b>Endorse block, raise to indef</b>: I'm another user who has been harangued and pursued by Winkelvi, much as Coretheapple and other describe, when he inserted himself into a discussion for the sole purpose of personal attacks and to stir trouble, and participated in an edit war about which he knew nothing in an effort to prosecute some old (and in my case, imaginary) grudge, most recently at <a href="/wiki/The_Crown_(TV_series)" title="The Crown (TV series)">The Crown (TV series)</a>, but also in at least one other article. He's also done the same with <a href="/wiki/User:Calibrador" title="User:Calibrador">Calibrador</a> in recent days. He works the "I'm on the spectrum" card for all it's worth, but speaking as someone with Ph.D.-level expertise and 30 years in the field, his social and communication skills are far too developed for a person with Asperger's syndrome. People, as uncomfortable a thought as this might be, some people with disabilities do actually abuse their disability rights, and Winklevi does so. How long will our bleeding hearts protect him, at the expense of how many editors he hassles and harangues? How many chances will it take before the community realizes he is a lost cause, and should be indeffed? --<a href="/wiki/User:Drmargi" title="User:Drmargi">Drmargi</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Drmargi" title="User talk:Drmargi">talk</a>) 19:40, 18 March 2017 (UTC)

<li><b>Endorse block, support unblock with indefinite 1RR restriction.</b> - <a href="/wiki/User:Coffee" title="User:Coffee">Coffee</a>'s block was proportionate and reasonable. I believe that Winkelvi has the best intentions, and that his contributions are a net positive. That said, his doggedness is his Achilles heel. Since he is rule-bound, following a one revert restriction should be no problem. Personally I follow 1RR except in the most extreme situations, which I find avoids a great many conflicts. Winkelvi could benefit from the realization that any truly bad edit will probably be addressed by another editor, so he should not feel it imperative to correct it himself. My advice to Winknelvi to go out of his way to be accommodating to regular editors who push back. As to <a href="/wiki/User:NeilN" title="User:NeilN">NeilN</a>'s suggestion, I thing a mentor would be beneficiaL.

<li>Drmies has opined on his talk page that Winkelvi "can't do all that much about his self-disclosed condition."<a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Drmies&amp;diff=770990972&amp;oldid=770990874">[46]</a> I don't think an editor who holds such an opinion should mentor this user (and I believe it has been tried in the past).

<li>We've also noted that one of the problems with WV's behavior is his tendency to ping numerous friendly admins hoping that he will get some support. So I'm not sure why we should appoint one of his favorite admins to "mentor" him. I don't mean to offend Drmies. It's WV's behavior that is concerning me. Also, can we please stop calling him "rule bound?" WV uses the rules when he thinks they will help him. But when they don't, he ignores them. Those 6 blocks for edit-warring tell the story very clearly. <a href="/wiki/User:Display_name_99" title="User:Display name 99">Display name 99</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Display_name_99" title="User talk:Display name 99">talk</a>) 23:12, 18 March 2017 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/User:Display_name_99" title="User:Display name 99">Display name 99</a>, I think you misunderstand "mentor". It means a friendly but possibly strict coach; it doesn't mean "cop who keeps someone on a leash". That I'm supposed to be "friendly" to Winkelvi is yet to be determined, and at any rate that's your assessment of Winkelvi's hypothetical assessment of my attitude toward Winkelvi--do you understand my point? You don't know, and neither does Winkelvi. But let's say I am in fact "friendly" to them (that I'm an admin has nothing to do with it)--why on earth would you want to give someone a mentor who is <i>unfriendly</i> to them? Isn't that just like taking out an insurance to make sure they'll fail? And can I repeat that I am not seeking to be anyone's mentor or feel qualified to be anyone's mentor? <a href="/wiki/User:Drmies" title="User:Drmies">Drmies</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Drmies" title="User talk:Drmies">talk</a>) 23:36, 18 March 2017 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/User:Drmies" title="User:Drmies">Drmies</a>, of course I wouldn't want the admin to be "unfriendly." My concern was the possibility of either bias in the admin or WV deciding to think that he had someone he could use to come to his rescue in the event of an argument, and nothing more. I understand your lack of enthusiasm for the job. I personally don't think that it will work, and repeat my statement that, due to the persistent and severe behavioral problems occurring over the past years and in spite of repeated warnings, an indefinite block is by far the best way to solve this crisis. <a href="/wiki/User:Display_name_99" title="User:Display name 99">Display name 99</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Display_name_99" title="User talk:Display name 99">talk</a>) 23:44, 18 March 2017 (UTC)

<li>That's not what mentors do, typically. I just got done sending a long email to my friend and colleague Coffee, with some details about someone from a while ago, in a case somewhat similar. This editor, who had similar editing behavior, got indeffed on the spot for all the right reasons and has worked themselves back into the fold, now without any restrictions and problems. I don't think I was necessarily their "mentor", but we had discussions via email, they'd ask me what I think they'd should do, and I'd tell them what, to the best of my ability, I thought was a good thing to do. Mentors, in my experience, don't necessarily go and jump in the middle of disputes; mentors aren't advocates, though they'll act in the best interest of their protege. So, I don't know about Winkelvi, there's no guarantees, but he's a human being and he's been here a while, and he's done some good (IMO much more good than bad), and I'm not going to give up on someone as long as they have an interest in improving our beautiful project. I will confess to something: in modern US parlance, I'm a liberal, I suppose, and that means, to me, that I don't easily give up on people. Frequently one gets very disappointed that way, and there are no ribbons or medals for getting it right, but I suppose I was Born This Way. And if 0R is the best I can get out of it, that's fine, though I prefer 1R, because 0R really means "we have no faith in you whatsoever"; 1R means "we don't trust you to stop on time". That's a big difference. <a href="/wiki/User:Drmies" title="User:Drmies">Drmies</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Drmies" title="User talk:Drmies">talk</a>) 02:21, 19 March 2017 (UTC)

<li><a href="/wiki/User:Drmies" title="User:Drmies">Drmies</a>, I understand not wanting to give up on people. But there comes a time when one must consider the common good. In this case, it is the interest of the project and the well-being of its contributors. If the person in question has shown a consistent failure to follow directions and change disruptive behavior, and causing countless other people a huge amount of anguish in the process, and has not given any indication that the behavior will change, any concern for that person must be made secondary to doing what is best for the community.</li>

<dd>You say that a 0R means "we have no faith in you whatsoever." And what reason would there be to have faith after 6 edit-warring blocks in 3 years? It's a good thing to not want to give up on people, but you also need to use some common sense to deal properly with abusive people who clearly aren't going to change. And because the abusive behavior extends beyond edit-warring, and includes extensive harassment, bludgeoning, and other forms of aggressive behavior on talk pages, it should be clear that a 0RR won't even come close to solving all our problems. Only an indefinite block, made after years of smaller blocks and warnings and countless hours spent by countless editors sorting through drama and trying to find a solution, can put this unwanted behavior to rest. <a href="/wiki/User:Display_name_99" title="User:Display name 99">Display name 99</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Display_name_99" title="User talk:Display name 99">talk</a>) 03:25, 19 March 2017 (UTC)

<li>Winkelvi has more edits than I do and has more time in the project (24,000 edits and nearly five years). We're beyond the point at which mentoring would do any good. It's been years and years and blocks and blocks. Even if mentoring was capable of working, I believe the mentor would have to believe that the editor in question was capable of changing his behavior and dealing with whatever behavioral issues he may have. Drmies has already indicated he has no such confidence, as I observed previously. Note <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Winkelvi&amp;oldid=639432746#Casting_aspersions">this exchange with Jehochman</a>.

<li>Coretheapple, please don't put words in my mouth. I didn't say I have no confidence Winkelvi can change his behavior; <i>au contraire</i>. And I'll say the same to you that I said before: you can't be a mentor if you're not sympathetic. That is not the same thing as "partisan"--a. it puts everything in the context of conflict, which is the wrong way to work in a collaborative project and b. a mentor is not a punisher. If you are somehow worried that this evil Winkelvi's mischief is going to go unnoticed because partisan admin Dr. whoever is shielding his misdeeds from the world, you're mistaken. All edits are out in the open, and by last count there were some two zillion editors <i>in this very thread</i> who want Winkelvi blocked indefinitely and will be keeping a close eye on him. <a href="/wiki/User:Drmies" title="User:Drmies">Drmies</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Drmies" title="User talk:Drmies">talk</a>) 02:25, 19 March 2017 (UTC)</li>

If so the situation is hopeless because <i>Winkelvi blames his behavior on his Asperger's.</i> For instance, in <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Winkelvi&amp;oldid=639432746#Casting_aspersions">this exchange</a> with <a href="/wiki/User:Jehochman" title="User:Jehochman">User:Jehochman</a>, he said "Jehochman, I'm not clueless, I have Asperger Syndrome." On his user page he has <i>two entire sections</i> on the subject. One says "If you've had any kind of issue or misunderstanding in your dealings with me, there is an excellent article/essay on Wikipedia editors with Asperger Syndrome found here that might help." Immediately below that, in a section entitled "About Me and Editing," he goes on and on about his Asperger's and how it influences his editing. He has another Asperger's notice at the top of his user talk page.</p>
<p>If we take him at his word that his behavior is caused by Aspergers, and if we accept your belief that he can't do much about it, then mentoring will not work and he needs to be indeffed for the good of the community. It isn't fair to expect that the community bear the brunt of this person's behavior, whatever its cause, if self-control is not in the cards. <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:High-functioning_autism_and_Asperger%27s_editors#Dealing_with_it_in_the_WikiWorld" title="Wikipedia:High-functioning autism and Asperger's editors">"Some people, whether on the autism spectrum or not, just don't belong in Wikipedia. Vandals, trolls, and abusive and disruptive editors can be blocked or banned, <b>and being on the autism spectrum is no excuse for unacceptable behaviour</b>."</a></p>
<p>I realize that you have a lot of empathy for Winkelvi, but you need to have empathy for the people who have to deal with him. The reason there are a "zillion people who want him indeffed" as you put it is not that we are evil, but because of his behavior. You have never had to put up with bad behavior from him, because he shows a different face to adminstrators. As numerous editors have pointed out, he's extra-nice to you guys (unless you block him). The rest of us don't have that advantage. <a href="/wiki/User:Coretheapple" title="User:Coretheapple">Coretheapple</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Coretheapple" title="User talk:Coretheapple">talk</a>) 05:00, 19 March 2017 (UTC)</p>

<li>Just to be clear, the problem with my long ago interaction with Winklevi, was yes edit warring, but also his unbelievably and intentionally ignorant arguments (eg, admitting he did not read sources) and offensive long drawn-out fights (over basically nothing, at all) and gross accusations (over less) - Winklevi needs be told straight out that he harms Wikipedia. He just has to shut down this manner of interaction, which begins with reversions, 0RR actually takes care of all that, if he can buy into it - read Anna's comment on his talk page, about going to write something worthwhile -- that is what he needs to do, (don't go near others work) if he has any hope, beyond the block. <a href="/wiki/User:Alanscottwalker" title="User:Alanscottwalker">Alanscottwalker</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Alanscottwalker" title="User talk:Alanscottwalker">talk</a>) 22:18, 18 March 2017 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Endorse block</b> Back in 2015, I had a rather <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Winkelvi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=653257048">acrimonious encounter</a> with Winkelvi when he reported another editor for edit warring. I will admit that WV's prediction that the other editor would continue to edit war did prove true so I'll give him that much. That other editor ultimately got himself indefinitely blocked for edit warring and socking, but that's by the by. I've generally avoided WV after that encounter. However, the argument does show that WV knows full well what it is to edit war and that any sort of prevarication is basically bullshit. Anything less than a <b>0RR</b> restriction upon expiry of the block would be too lenient. <a href="/wiki/User:Blackmane" title="User:Blackmane">Blackmane</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Blackmane" title="User talk:Blackmane">talk</a>) 11:33, 19 March 2017 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment.</b> I won't weigh in with any particular recommendation, because to me it just seems like a quibble about degree. But I would add that, just recently, I too had a rather difficult encounter with Winklevi. I found him to be unreasonable, illogical, stubborn and unwilling to engage in meaningful discussion. When he made up his mind, he was like a bulldog with a bone and that was it. So the question is, if that's someone's personality, is there really <i>any</i> administrative action that could reasonably be expected to change it?

<dd>My impression was that besides the hounding by immediately going to articles I started working on, his edits were clear provocations to edit war for pure joy. By the third article in a row, it was pretty obvious that he was treating edit wars as a form of sport. He also had some kind of clear backstage pass, since he got that other editor speedy blocked w/o notice and got me speedy blocked <a class="external text" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Light_show#Nonsense_block">twice in a row</a> at Commons on a near fabrication while edit warring at En/WP.

<dd><a href="/wiki/User:Light_show" title="User:Light show">Light show</a>, I read through that investigation. <a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/WordSeventeen/Archive#27_December_2016">[49]</a> It appears as though a Checkuser never confirmed the connection. I think that's a major problem. Every person accused of sockpuppetry should be entitled to a Checkuser search. This way, the sockpuppetry is confirmed, and so the indefinite block would not be based exclusively on circumstantial evidence. I'll admit that the circumstantial evidence in this case does seem to be strong-I've interacted with one confirmed WS sock before, an account by the name of Jilllyjo-and I have observed some similarities. Yet this shouldn't be enough. Finally, the connection is listed as "Likely." Then it was closed. Nothing else happened. In a criminal court, being able to argue that the defendant "likely" committed the crime is not enough for a conviction.</dd>
<dd>It's also worth noting that the blocking admin, Bbb23, was pinged by WV. Bbb23 also protested Coffee's decision to open this thread, so it appears he may be a bit sympathetic to Winkelvi. Thus, although it is beside the original point here, I <s><b>support</b></s> the investigation being reopened so that a CheckUser may be brought in to investigate. <a href="/wiki/User:Display_name_99" title="User:Display name 99">Display name 99</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Display_name_99" title="User talk:Display name 99">talk</a>) 04:24, 20 March 2017 (UTC)

<dd><a href="/wiki/User:Ivanvector" title="User:Ivanvector">Ivanvector</a>, I have one quick question before I strike my comment supporting the reinvestigation. If the CheckUser did indeed confirm that the two accounts came from the same IP address, why does it only say "Likely," and not "Confirmed," as it did, for example, in the Wordseventeen/Jilllyjo investigation? <a href="/wiki/User:Display_name_99" title="User:Display name 99">Display name 99</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Display_name_99" title="User talk:Display name 99">talk</a>) 15:27, 20 March 2017 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I can only guess since I wasn't involved with that investigation and don't have CheckUser access myself, but my interpretation is that a "likely" result indicates a <i>strong likelihood</i> of connection on a technical basis (versus "confirmed" which is <i>definitely the same user</i>), but still a positive result when the user's behaviour is also similar as it seemed to be here. Or more to the point: a CheckUser placed the block, so it's a CheckUser block. I trust Bbb23 would not annotate the block log in that way if there were any doubt. <a href="/wiki/User:Ivanvector" title="User:Ivanvector">Ivanvector</a> (<sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ivanvector" title="User talk:Ivanvector">Talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Ivanvector" title="Special:Contributions/Ivanvector">Edits</a></sub>) 16:44, 20 March 2017 (UTC)

<li><b>Indefinite block</b>. As someone who also had a nightmarish encounter with Winkelvi, I knew it was just a matter of time before his behavior came into light. He is quick to accuse other people, but when someone challenges him on his own behavior, he gets extremely defensive and cries "personal attack". With Winkelvi, he can do no wrong and its always someone else's fault. His problem is much bigger than edit warring. He was recently given a two month block(<a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Archive284#Self-promotion_by_User:Calibrador">[50]</a>) a few months back and the first thing he did when it expired was lash out at two admins.<a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Winkelvi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=749175616">[51]</a><a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Winkelvi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=749189603">[52]</a> Does this look like someone who learned his lesson and can change his behavior? Despite a lengthy two month block, he was still defiant and told the admin he was wrong and learned <b>nothing</b>. I don't know how he got away with that and I am not sure if the admin ever read his comment. This is a user who can not admit that he is ever wrong and will never change. He also knows the rules clearly and is always reporting other users for edit warring, so no one should buy his excuse about being confused about the rules. Due his battleground behavior and earlier feud with me(long story), he even reported me at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:ANEW" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:ANEW">WP:ANEW</a> <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RRArchive325#User:TL565_reported_by_User:Winkelvi_.28Result:_Meh.29">here</a> over a time stamp which was quickly dismissed as probably the most ridiculous and pettiest report ever on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> I've not had any dealings with Winkelvi (that I recall), so I can't really comment on their conduct, or who they might have rubbed up the wrong way. However, I'm more concerned that the starting point of this block was a malformed report at the edit-war notice board by an IP who appeared out of nowhere to only disappear again. Apologies if that's already been brought up in this thread, but there's a lot of text here already, and I find that to be a major part of this which appears to be overlooked. <b><a href="/wiki/User:Lugnuts" title="User:Lugnuts"><font color="#002BB8">Lugnuts</font></a></b> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Lugnuts" title="User talk:Lugnuts">Precious bodily fluids</a></sup> 08:02, 20 March 2017 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I didn't see anything wrong with it. It was just an IP who noticed the hypocrisy of Winkelvi's report on another user for violating the 3RR when he had just as many reverts.

<dd>For what it's worth, in most cases I have seen (perhaps not this one -- I haven't checked) the real hypocrisy is claiming that the only thing that matters on ANEW is the number of reverts, as I mentioned (somewhat vaguely) in my earlier comment. Again, I haven't looked into this most recent edit war, but for the sake of argument imagine that Winkelvi had been desperately pinging the other user on the talk page and presenting reasonable arguments for his version, and the other user was either ignoring said comments completely and not posting on the talk page at all or posting variations on "You're wrong" or "I don't care" (or even "You are a stupid poopy-head" -- I've seen it happen). In this scenario, Winkelvi would still be wrong to revert multiple times (he should have just come to ANEW first), but he would clearly be the less guilty of "edit-warring". If Winkelvi, after edit-warring back, <i>then</i> decides to go to ANEW, that still is not hypocrisy on his part -- it's him doing what he should have done to begin with. Again I should specify that this is only in response to TL565's comment above; I am not saying definitely that anything like this scenario happened here. It's just that since it has happened before. I once narrowly escaped a block for having taken bait like this (since there was tag-teaming/meatpuppetry involved, the other party hadn't even technically breached 3RR yet), so it's kind of a pet peeve of mine. <a href="/wiki/User:Hijiri88" title="User:Hijiri88">Hijiri 88</a> (<small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Hijiri88" title="User talk:Hijiri88">聖</a><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Hijiri88" title="Special:Contributions/Hijiri88">やや</a></small>) 09:01, 20 March 2017 (UTC)

<dd>Just to be clear: by "malformed" all it means is that the IP didn't follow the correct format for reporting a 3RR violation <a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RRArchive338#Winkelvi_.28Result:_Blocked.29">[54]</a>. If you examine the edit history of the Billy the Kid article<a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Billy_the_Kid&amp;action=history">[55]</a> you can see that it was clearly a 3RR violation. But what's striking is what he was edit warring over. <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Billy_the_Kid&amp;diff=770621427&amp;oldid=770607557">Here is the diff</a> of the edit in question. These are piddling, inconsequential, trivial wording changes, such as changing active voice into passive. (E.g., changing "reviewed the photo" into "the photo was reviewed"). This is <i>identical</i> to his behavior in <a href="/wiki/Bess_Myerson" title="Bess Myerson">Bess Myerson</a> 26 months ago, down to the last detail in the sense that he pushed the revert button repeatedly over trivial, inconsequential semantic issues in the article. <a href="/wiki/User:Coretheapple" title="User:Coretheapple">Coretheapple</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Coretheapple" title="User talk:Coretheapple">talk</a>) 13:26, 20 March 2017 (UTC)

I'm usually inclined to cut people slack when it comes to failure to conform to templates like that because, honestly, a lot of the instructions on Wikipedia noticeboards and the like are really difficult to follow, especially when it <i>looks</i> like ANEW works essentially the same as AN and its other subpages like this one. Frankly, it's increasingly hard to assume good faith on the part of the users who write some of those instructions, as from time to time when questioned they seem to indicate that the goal is to make it difficult to use such-and-such process and so decrease the rate and which said process is used (I'm <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:GAR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:GAR">not talking specifically about ANEW</a> here). <a href="/wiki/User:Hijiri88" title="User:Hijiri88">Hijiri 88</a> (<small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Hijiri88" title="User talk:Hijiri88">聖</a><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Hijiri88" title="Special:Contributions/Hijiri88">やや</a></small>) 13:35, 20 March 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The debate here is mostly in reference to this ANEW entry: <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RRArchive338#Winkelvi_.28Result:_Blocked.29" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RRArchive338">WP:Administrators' noticeboard/3RRArchive338#Winkelvi (Result: Blocked)</a>. A new IP address appears, alleges, <i>"Winkelvi made four reverts in 11 hours on the same page"</i> but doesn't even say which page this was, so that's unverifiable, and Coffee blocked them for 3 months within an hour and without any sort of discussion or clarification as to what had happened.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This is a bad block. Not because Winkelvi wasn't edit-warring, but because on-demand long blocks by passing socks have traditionally required IRC or requests at Wikipediocracy, not just an unformed handwave at ANEW. That is a much worse thing than anything Winkelvi was doing. <a href="/wiki/User:Andy_Dingley" title="User:Andy Dingley">Andy Dingley</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Andy_Dingley" title="User talk:Andy Dingley">talk</a>) 13:30, 20 March 2017 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think that an IP not abiding by proper format makes it a "bad block." There's no question that was a terrible 3RR report, in the sense of not even mentioning that it was in <a href="/wiki/Billy_the_Kid" title="Billy the Kid">Billy the Kid</a>. But to figure out what he meant, all one had to do was look in Winkelvi's recent edit history, and there it was. This was not an accusation of sockpuppetry, just something very obvious. Keep in mind too that people are blocked for edit warring all the time, without any ANEW report being filed. <a href="/wiki/User:Coretheapple" title="User:Coretheapple">Coretheapple</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Coretheapple" title="User talk:Coretheapple">talk</a>) 13:42, 20 March 2017 (UTC)</dd>

Rather than taking a quick look at the actual circumstances, you propose an alternative scenario so that you can bring up a pet peeve that does not apply?

It started when I <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Billy_the_Kid&amp;diff=770562185&amp;oldid=770558271">reverted</a> Winkelvi's reversion of an IP editor's copy edits (which were completely valid). I've had other run-ins with him at the same article, and found Winkelevi's intransigence to be the single greatest impediment to the article's progression toward GA status, which was strange, considering that he was the nominating editor. His interactions with the poor reviewers who accepted the thankless task of dealing with him were a sight to see. I can only say that in the years (since 2011) I've been editing, Winkelvi is by far the most unpleasant person I've ever tried to work with, inside WP or outside. The history of his behavior in the many negative encounters he's had on WP speaks volumes.

I am under no obligation to comment any further on this particular case than I already have; I presented my opinion on what should be done in this case (which was a very popular opinion, not an "alternative scenario [...] that doesn't apply") three days ago. I said "perhaps" merely because I was not sure either way (as far as I am concerned, it doesn't make the slightest bit of difference regarding what should be done here), and for the purpose of what I wanted to write I was under no obligation to find out. It was <i><b>NOT</b></i> meant to imply that I had looked into the specific details here and was unable to figure out whether or not what I said applied. The rest of your comment beyond the second sentence has nothing whatsoever to do with me, and so I will not address it. (For the record, I too have interacted with Winkelvi in the past and found his behaviour unpleasant. That has nothing whatsoever to do with what I wrote.

If this was the case every single editor here, when blocked, would never use the {{<a href="/wiki/Template:Unblock" title="Template:Unblock">unblock</a>}} system anymore... we could all just ping who we wanted to be on the panel of our fate. This is why the policy states: <span class="inline-quote-talk" style="font-family: Georgia, 'DejaVu Serif', serif; color: #008560;">Except in cases of unambiguous error or significant change in circumstances dealing with the reason for blocking, administrators should avoid unblocking users without first attempting to contact the blocking administrator to discuss the matter. If the blocking administrator is not available, or if the administrators cannot come to an agreement, then a discussion at the administrators' noticeboard is recommended.</span> Furthermore, it looks like you may be accidentally misreading what <a href="/wiki/User:Alanscottwalker" title="User:Alanscottwalker">Alan</a> wrote. I (and Alan can correct me if I'm wrong) believe he was merely referring to what impression your comments might make upon WV and what affect that might have on him (e.g. a future indefinite block due to unhindered disruptive behavior). At any rate, I'd rather we not blow this up too far out of proportion; I've already fully explained my reasoning for coming here.

<p>Reading through the above a few times, I think there are two main courses of action editors are recommending:</p>
<ol>
<li>An indefinite block</li>
<li>An unblock with an indefinite 0RR or 1RR editing restriction.</li>
</ol>
<p>It'd be helpful when judging consensus if editors stating a preference above could indicate if they could live with the other option. --<a href="/wiki/User:NeilN" title="User:NeilN"><b style="color:navy">Neil<span style="color:red">N</span></b></a> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:NeilN" title="User talk:NeilN"><i style="color:blue">talk to me</i></a></sup> 17:23, 20 March 2017 (UTC)</p>

<li>Remove temptation, from someone, who behaves as if they cannot handle it, and then gets into obnoxious BATTLE over their reversion: <b>Block and 0 RR</b>, sure if they take the 0 RR, I am neutral on ending block early.

<li><b>Indefinite block</b> It'd be a matter of days before the 0RR/1RR restriction is broken - not because the editor would deliberately do it, but because their <s>temper</s> enthusiasm would get the better of them. <a href="/wiki/User:Exemplo347" title="User:Exemplo347">Exemplo347</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Exemplo347" title="User talk:Exemplo347">talk</a>) 17:37, 20 March 2017 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>As indicated above, I'd definitely prefer <b>indefinite</b>. <s>However, I could live with letting the block expire after the full 90 days and then going with an indefinite 0RR after that.</s> However, there's no way I could do 1RR.

<li><b>Comment</b> I favor an <b>indefinite block</b>, and I think an immediate unblock with a 1RR or even 0RR restriction would be a mistake and would be unfair to the editors in subject areas in which Winkelvi is a prolific contributor. It's kicking the can down the road. It's not just reversions and edit warring, it's a general cluelessness, a refusal to "get the point." Even without reverting, an editor can wreak havoc on talk pages, driving away editors by filibustering and wall-o-text rants, very much as Winkelvi did at Myerson and as he began to do at Billy the Kid. And over what? Nothing. Passive versus active voice. Little turns of phrase. Whether someone should be called a "singer-songwriter" or a "singer and songwriter." In fact, even if a 0RR restriction had been in force in January 2015, the nightmare that he inflected on other editors on the Myerson talk page would have been just as awful. He's been shown plenty of compassion and given multiple chances. Time to show compassion for the rest of us, <a href="/wiki/User:Coretheapple" title="User:Coretheapple">Coretheapple</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Coretheapple" title="User talk:Coretheapple">talk</a>) 17:45, 20 March 2017 (UTC)</li>
<li>The problem with an 'indef block' is that a)its not a ban and so not subject to community input to lift, and b)any admin can unblock in the future based on whatever Wink can convince them of - as they have an extensive history of saying 'I'll change' this is clearly a suboptimal solution. So regardless of their block length/when they are unblocked, he needs a <b>0RR restriction which can only be lifted by community consensus</b>. He is well aware of 1rr, 3rr etc and since he has repeatedly (there is ample evidence above) shown no interest in not edit warring despite knowing full well what it is and all the details around what constitutes a revert, only 0RR has a hope of working. I say working, but I mean 'cause less disruption to other editors'. <a href="/wiki/User:Only_in_death" title="User:Only in death">Only in death does duty end</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Only_in_death" title="User talk:Only in death">talk</a>) 17:57, 20 March 2017 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Indefinite block</b>. Let's just recap the situation. He was blocked in June 2014 for edit warring. January 2015 for edit warring over multiple pages. Twice in March 2015 for edit warring and disruptive editing. July 2015 for edit warring (overturned on a technicality). November 2015 for edit warring (ditto). January 2016 for edit warring. May 2016 for feuding with multiple editors. September 2016 for harassment. March 2017 for edit warring. That's ten blocks in the period of 1,000 days -- one every three months. It's clear this behavior has not stopped and I don't see any positives to outweigh the many negatives other editors have described above. (Note that he could still ask the community to have the block lifted in the future -- indefinite isn't infinite -- and it might be good if <i>he</i> were the one saying what he would do differently to avoid confrontations instead of us offering him lifelines in the form of revert restrictions.) <b><span style="border: 1px #60768E solid;background:#60768E"><a href="/wiki/User:Calidum" title="User:Calidum"><font color="#FFFDD0">Calidum</font></a></span></b> 18:06, 20 March 2017 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - neutral with regard to indefinite block, it's not my preferred option but Winkelvi has clearly exhausted the patience of many editors. I oppose 0RR in any case as I've only ever seen it lead to gaming the definition of a revert followed by more dramah (I mean generally, not just in this case).

<li><b>Indefinite block</b>. It's clear that there is a significant body of administrators who can be manipulated by Winklevi, leaving me with no confidence that the 0RR/1RR restriction and subsequent mandatory indef would be enforced. Worse, were Coffee to do so, he'd be subject to a quick hauling over the coals by at least some of his administrative peers. Moreover, it's clear that the experiences of those of us who have been on the receiving end of Winklevi's behavior are of little consequence to the group Winklevi has wrapped around his little finger, and we will continue to be pursued, harangued and hassled by him. Given that, the one and only acceptable choice is to indefinitely block him. --<a href="/wiki/User:Drmargi" title="User:Drmargi">Drmargi</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Drmargi" title="User talk:Drmargi">talk</a>) 18:13, 20 March 2017 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - A site ban may be overly harsh in this situation. Why not <b>finish his current block then 0RR indefinitely</b>?

<li><b>Indefinite block</b> is my preferred solution, which I support with great regret in this and other cases. I have spent a lot of time reading all of the background information in the past several days and that has been a depressing process that has failed to convince me that a more lenient outcome would be better for the encyclopedia. In the sake of disclosure, I had a brief and unpleasant interaction with this editor a couple of years ago, and have steered clear since. Of course, I could live with another solution because I accept consensus. <a href="/wiki/User:Cullen328" title="User:Cullen328"><b style="color:#070">Cullen</b><sup style="color:#707">328</sup></a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Cullen328" title="User talk:Cullen328"><span style="color:#00F"><i>Let's discuss it</i></span></a> 19:43, 20 March 2017 (UTC)</li>
<li>I've started to post in this thread a couple of times now, and deleted what I wrote because it made me want to bash my head into a wall, and then come back to it to find it even worse. I see I waited too long and we're now in the "Requests for Banning" phase. This whole thing, from top to bottom, is basically How Not To ANI: The Thread. The tendency of ANI to escalate drama and work up a crowd is well attested. I think it's often underappreciated how frustrating and distressing editors can find these long threads in which people show up to pick apart the subject's perceived personal faults as exhibited over the last several years. (Likewise with frequent comments from the blocking admin on the blocked editor's talk page. Best to let others step in.) The original plan worked out by a group of admins familiar with the situation - unblock after some time to think + 1RR - is a sensible one. Most of the comments here overlook the fact that 1RR <i>did</i> work pretty well in the past, but the restriction expired. So renew it. (There's also a lot of pixels spilled on the length of the block log, but "gets blocked once every six months for 3RR" is really not the kind of thing that breaks the wiki. He's hardly the only established editor who occasionally goes over that line.) Since he says he'd prefer to wait out the block than work under a 0RR restriction, I suppose those are my second and third choices. The proposals for an indefinite block or siteban are unwarranted. <a href="/wiki/User:Opabinia_regalis" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Opabinia_regalis" title="User talk:Opabinia regalis">talk</a>) 19:51, 20 March 2017 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I disagree. I think 0RR is worth a try. Indef, just means until someone unblocks - it is often quite short. The reason 0RR would work, is it takes away the incentive to enter these BATTLES, at all.<a href="/wiki/User:Alanscottwalker" title="User:Alanscottwalker">Alanscottwalker</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Alanscottwalker" title="User talk:Alanscottwalker">talk</a>) 20:19, 20 March 2017 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>True, there is that possibility. But if you have 0RR, there would be no impact on talk-page concerns such as you I believe noted. That's why a site ban makes sense. Reading CBAN, it seems specifically tailored for this kind of situation. <a href="/wiki/User:Coretheapple" title="User:Coretheapple">Coretheapple</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Coretheapple" title="User talk:Coretheapple">talk</a>) 20:30, 20 March 2017 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Again, I think the talk page BATTLE stems form the reversion warring, and trying to "protect" his re - <b>version</b> using his battle tactics. Remove reversion temptation at all means remove the reason for BATTLE - means he goes and does something else, like create articles on on his own or with someone, as Anna suggested on the talk page. <a href="/wiki/User:Alanscottwalker" title="User:Alanscottwalker">Alanscottwalker</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Alanscottwalker" title="User talk:Alanscottwalker">talk</a>) 20:36, 20 March 2017 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But all 0RR means is that the battle shifts to the talk page. He has his preferred wording. He puts it up there. It is reverted. Now instead of revert-warring he takes it to the talk page and calamity ensues. I believe this happened when Myerson was protected, as I believe it was. Yes, hopefully he would stop that behavior. But he won't.. I trust you know how hard it is to deal with such situations. It's not like 3RR, which is cut and dried. We just had a situation like that in another article, involving a small group of editors who went against consensus.</dd>

<dd>Like DHeyward, you're missing the point. The reason there is so much agreement on this thread is because hundreds of good-faith editors have been at the receiving end of Winkelvi's obstinate, relentless, heedless, and highly disruptive behavior over the past several years, often multiple times in different venues. The Bess Myerson article is just <i>one</i> example out of several hundred. If there were an ArbCom case, people would present dozens more (I myself have several examples). If you have not been on the receiving end of Winkevli's harassment (and very few admins have; WV knows better), then you do not have the same experience others here do. And ANI is not "supposed to work [by] independent review by uninvolved people with fresh eyes". It is for knowledgeable and experienced editors to give their best recommendations. Lastly, if you think the Bess Myerson article example is a "minor" content dispute, then you have not examined it thoroughly.

<dd>No I am not missing the point nor is Opabinia regalis. I've been around the block to know the difference between a collective feeling of low-level annoyance and long term abusive editors. The lack of diffs, lack of ANI reports, lack of AE reports and virtually no diffs except for multi-year one-off encounters. If he has such a record, take him to ArbCom. This ANI has all the markings of a pile-on with each editor that ever had an unpleasant experience leaves their "death by a thousand cuts" diffless anecdote. I have now read Bess Myerson talk page and he had valid criticism and input. So much so, that only a technical violation of 3RR would warrant a block. There was no abuse or disruption and he called for sourcing where there wasn't any. Nothing wrong with that at all. Another example is how many of winkelvi's detractors lament his pinging admins to his talk page. None of the pinged admins cared. No one thought it necessary to remove talk page access. Yet, there are busy-bodies here that are upset by this behavior. Why is that? It doesn't concern them. It doesn't bother the admins - that makes it defacto not disruptive. But that's another hallmark of piling on. He's not pinging or berating those that are making rather broad accusations against him without diffs. These "one time at band camp..." anecdote need a lot more evidence, not just torches and pitchforks. The place for that is ArbCom because what's hear at ANI is too shallow to warrant additional sanctions. --<a href="/wiki/User:DHeyward" title="User:DHeyward">DHeyward</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:DHeyward" title="User talk:DHeyward">talk</a>) 04:38, 22 March 2017 (UTC)

<dd>Of course the pinged admins didn't care -- he chose admins who were predisposed towards him. There are plenty of diffs and links provided in this thread -- not all of them sufficiently relevant, but enough of them are. And you didn't look at all of the 120 edits WV made to Bess Myerson in 2.5 days including endless edit-warring over some of his unnecessary changes. There is some degree of piling on in this thread, but that's because WV has relentlessly targeted hundreds of good-faith editors over the years. Beyond the piling on, however, you'll find very experienced and circumspect editors and admins such as Cullen328, The Wordsmith, Neutrality, Black Kite, QEDK, Ealdgyth, Calidum, and Blackmane endorsing a three-month block (or longer) and/or a 0RR restriction. So it's hardly an overall pile-on, however much I may disagree with an indef block. <a href="/wiki/User:Softlavender" title="User:Softlavender">Softlavender</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Softlavender" title="User talk:Softlavender">talk</a>) 05:37, 22 March 2017 (UTC)

<li><b>Endorse Block + indefinite 1RR</b>. I am not a fan of indefinite blocks and I also don't think we need to unblock at this point in time. I too, like many editors, have had my run ins with WV and I think while the block was 100% righteous, we can give WV some rope. WV states that he responds well to cut in stone rulings, so we can do that. When he is able to edit again, it should be under indefinite 1RR restrictions. Further edit warring and attacks should result in laddering of blocks. <a href="/wiki/User:Sir_Joseph" title="User:Sir Joseph">Sir Joseph</a> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Sir_Joseph" title="User talk:Sir Joseph"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:07, 20 March 2017 (UTC)</li>

This ANI thread has been more disruptive and been more of an "administrative burden" than anything Winkelvi has done. He's a passionate editor over a very small topic area. That's the type of editor we want to rehabiliate and retain, not site ban. Since the caustic nature of this ANI post has driven many of the contributing admins away, there is no way to form a consensus that changes the status quo. He's been blocked for 3 months because of a 4th revert to that highly watched, hotbed of controversy article of <a href="/wiki/Billy_the_Kid" title="Billy the Kid">Billy the Kid</a> - apparently the cause of much "administrator burden." Oh and two years ago, I understand that people were upset with his talk page comments at the article <a href="/wiki/Bess_Myerson" title="Bess Myerson">Bess Myerson</a>. I could probably get more detail if I read those articles. He has not participated in this ANI mudslinging contest which has actually caused more disruption than anything Winkelvi has done. Keep in mind, we are NOT at ANI because of Winkelvi. Winkelvi was given a 3 month block which was not contested here or brought here by him or anyone seeking a change. Had he been lucky enough to have received an Arbitration Enforcement block, this ANI would have been closed as out-of-process. Think about that: our highest burden articles would not have allowed this process to occur, yet there are editors that think he should receive harsher punishment.

<dd>The Billy the kid revert is why he was blocked for 3 months. I did not bring up Bess Myerson but those seeking his ban surely did and they hold a two year old grudge as if he was still actively editing it. For reference, the two year old "talk page bullying" is much smaller than this ANI as well as being much more civil. The entire ten year history of the Bess Myerson talk page is smaller than this ANI. Winkelvi has no authority or rope to bully anybody and no evidence has been presented that he has done so - specifically the editor that he was edit warring with was blocked for a day for the same issue and the same "administrative burden." Beth Myerson was not a "nightmare" by any stretch of the imagination. If those are the strongest indicators of his poor behavior, there is a problem with the system, not Winkelvi. Those were lame an tedious but a real yawner in terms of drama. I care less about the number of blocks and more about circumstances and if the 4th revert on Billy the Kid and talk page kerfufle on [[[Bess Myerson]]] that occurred 2 years ago and is so small, the entirety of it hasn't been archived in nearly ten years.. If the 10 blocks are as lame as those examples, he's not a problem that needs banning or anything more than a revert restriction. His biggest crime on Billy the Kid was that he was forcing BRD when others were not and they edit warred until both broke 3RR. Happens every day. For that, Winkelvi was described as "most unpleasant person (they)'ve ever tried to work with, inside WP or outside." After an edit war over copy edits. That's just doesn't get past the BS meter.

(I'm not sure how to achieve that, but perhaps something like an agreement not to post more than twice in any given disagreement.) <u>We really need to cover article-talk discussions in the sanctions, since WV can bludgeon even a simple well-cited RfC discussion into infinity with endless irrelevant arguments.</u> <a href="/wiki/User:Softlavender" title="User:Softlavender">Softlavender</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Softlavender" title="User talk:Softlavender">talk</a>) 02:34, 21 March 2017 (UTC); edited 07:56, 21 March 2017 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This discussion was framed as a choice between two polar opposite alternatives, blocking indefinitely and unblocking while imposing editing restrictions. Perhaps the solution is to <b>affirm the three month block</b> and at the conclusion thereof impose an <b>0RR restriction plus an article talk page restriction</b> of some kind.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There is more than one way to create mayhem and harass another editor. I had an unpleasant entanglement with Winkelvi back in the first quarter of 2015. It happened because Winkelvi edited an article on my watch list and we went through the usual dance of an editor making a <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:BOLD" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:BOLD">BOLD</a> edit and then not following <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:BRD" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:BRD">WP:BRD</a>. However that is not the reason for this comment (as such behaviour has been covered by many other editors). This comment is to highlight something else. For reasons now obscured in the mists of time (ie. I can not be bothered to look into the history of many articles to find the root cause), Winkelvi became involved with a dispute with <a href="/wiki/User:Kbabej" title="User:Kbabej">user:Kbabej</a>. Winkelvi targeted many articles that <a href="/wiki/User:Kbabej" title="User:Kbabej">user:Kbabej</a> had created, or had made more than a trivial contribution. If the article had a significant history Winkelvi would change it, and then edit war to keep the change (see for example <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_Hastings_Hunkins&amp;oldid=591935182">the creation</a> and a section on the talk page: <a href="/wiki/Talk:Robert_Hastings_Hunkins#WP:UNDUE" title="Talk:Robert Hastings Hunkins">Talk:Robert Hastings Hunkins#WP:UNDUE</a>). But another tactic employed by Winkelvi was the use of AfDs targeted at articles created by <a href="/wiki/User:Kbabej" title="User:Kbabej">user:Kbabej</a> whether or not there were reasonable grounds for doing so. 0/1RR only tackle edit warring in article space, they do [not] stop other sorts of harassment: <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20150401000000&amp;limit=250&amp;contribs=user&amp;target=Winkelvi&amp;namespace=4&amp;tagfilter=&amp;hideMinor=1">links to relevant AfDs</a> in particular look at the period 03:16–03:46, 6 March 2015 when <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Twinkle" title="Wikipedia:Twinkle">Twinkle</a> was used by Winkelvi to create about 20 AfDs. -- <a href="/wiki/User:PBS" title="User:PBS">PBS</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:PBS" title="User talk:PBS">talk</a>) 14:55, 21 March 2017 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I didn't understand what you meant by "time stamp," so I wasted three minutes of my life to look at the edit history. I think it's important for editors to understand what happened, so I will briefly elaborate. An editor (hereinafter "Dave") posted a talk page comment that he neglected to sign. Some time later he signed it. The date stamp was inaccurate, as it was off by some minutes from the time he actually wrote the comment. TL565 <s>(who deserved a trout slap for doing this)</s> changed the time stamp to reflect when "Dave" actually posted it. Winkelvi objected. An edit war began. Then an AN3 discussion initiated by Winkelvi. Over nothing. <a href="/wiki/User:Coretheapple" title="User:Coretheapple">Coretheapple</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Coretheapple" title="User talk:Coretheapple">talk</a>) 01:10, 22 March 2017 (UTC)

<dd><a href="/wiki/User:TL565" title="User:TL565">TL565</a>, that's probably the most ridiculous report for anything that I've ever seen on Wikipedia. Also, I like how he reported you for edit-warring after only 2 reverts, but later claimed that he didn't think he deserved a block after 4 of them. The hypocrisy is almost beyond belief. <a href="/wiki/User:Display_name_99" title="User:Display name 99">Display name 99</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Display_name_99" title="User talk:Display name 99">talk</a>) 01:14, 22 March 2017 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Wow. Having looked over all the complaints about Winkelvi here, and some of the voluminous discussions involving him elsewhere, I get the impression that he enjoys conflict. There is an unusual amount of animosity being expressed here, even for ANI. When someone repeatedly engages in behavior that has had negative consequences for them, it's because they're getting some kind of psychological payoff. Winkelvi is the star of these wiki-battles, the star of the show, so to speak, and attention is centered on him.

<li>I finally had to take a breather from all this, being a working girl, but came back to look at the progress, and continue to be appalled by what I see. It seems to trouble no one that Winklevi has essentially called all of us who have reported our issues with him liars. To her credit, BethNaught gave him a chance to make a statement, but instead, he chose to climb up on the cross and play the martyr. His choice, of course, but to what end? Well, it certainly cuts off our ability to confront him about the waves of bullshit, harassment, pursuit ad nauseam that many of of us have been subjected to. Meanwhile, the "poor widdle Winklevi" pageant drags on with no action, and we who are in his line of sight must wait for some sort of solution to his widespread, chronic and highly problematic behavior. Again, when are we going to be the priority of the administrative corps weighing in, rather than an editor with a long block log and a massive collection of excuses? --<a href="/wiki/User:Drmargi" title="User:Drmargi">Drmargi</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Drmargi" title="User talk:Drmargi">talk</a>) 01:40, 22 March 2017 (UTC)</li>

<li>Especially after the Calibrador and timestamp discussions were posted, and of course all the other evidence that has been submitted, I can't see how anyone who isn't a buddy of Winkelvi can be in favor of anything less than an indefinite block. (I'm not accusing anybody, I'm just saying that it doesn't make sense to me.) These issues demonstrate a clear intention by Winkelvi to harass, stalk, and bully editors that he doesn't like. It's about time we got a consensus here to get this disruptive and unhelpful editor off this website indefinitely. Some sort of <b>community ban</b> would definitely take care of it for me. <a href="/wiki/User:Display_name_99" title="User:Display name 99">Display name 99</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Display_name_99" title="User talk:Display name 99">talk</a>) 02:14, 22 March 2017 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, that's not correct. Another user with <s>very</s> uncannily similar issues (edit warring over nothing; tendentious editing on talk pages) and a <i>much</i> shorter block log was indefinitely blocked for disruptive editing after an ANI discussion similar to this one. I don't know how kosher it is to identify that user, but if anyone asks, I will link to the ANI at which he was permablocked. The primary difference is that user's failure to cultivate administrators to bail him out, run interference for him in situations like this, and give him another chance and another chance and another chance. <a href="/wiki/User:Coretheapple" title="User:Coretheapple">Coretheapple</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Coretheapple" title="User talk:Coretheapple">talk</a>) 03:20, 22 March 2017 (UTC)</li>
<li>As a matter of fact that editor had only been blocked <i>two</i> times previously, both as part of the same dispute in which he/she was indefinitely blocked for disruptive editing. I think one of the comments in that ANI is worth repeating as it applies to this situation as well:</li>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Personally, I don't like the idea of letting more damage being caused by this user; I'd prefer skipping straight to the most nuclear option available because this sort of tendentious editing is such a time-wasting exercise for existing contributors, and more dangerously, it has the effect of chasing away the limited resources we have too permanently. . . . I have yet to find a situation where the net outcome for the project has been positive by delaying sanctions in the never-ending wait for a user with these sorts of issues to reach the required level of improvement. Rehabilitation on the English wiki hasn't been successful for this type of issue, and has in fact caused further cuts (read: burn-out) to the resources available here. The community has had more than enough experience with earlier good faith attempts at fixing this type of issue which has repeatedly proved ineffective, and it is simply at the point where it cannot afford to keep making the same mistake.</i></p>

As you can see, I didn't have as much patience with him as some other users. This is someone who will never admit to making any mistake.

<li>having read through those two ANEW reports, all I can say is "Wow, just wow" at the complete and utter pettiness of them. <a href="/wiki/User:Blackmane" title="User:Blackmane">Blackmane</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Blackmane" title="User talk:Blackmane">talk</a>) 02:30, 22 March 2017 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support any escalation</b> - incl. indef 1RR, indef 0RR, or (extremely unfortunately) indef block. I have only rarely interacted with Winkelvi and these interactions were quite cordial. I have had far sourer interactions for which I would not request an indef block than almost any presented here, I am however extremely concerned about the hounding of calibrador described far above and another editor whom I cannot name because it has been lost somewhere in the mess. Winkelvi has, in my estimation, done some good work for the project. In this sense I would hate for the esclation chosen to be an indefinite block and absolutely despise even the notion of a community ban. A CBAN would perfectly exemplify the nature of AN/I's reputation for stoking minor flames into engorging blazes. That said, to anybody not viewing this through a rose-tinted ("tinted" really it's two-layered frosted glass you can't see anything through) lens, it should be apparent that <i>doing nothing</i> (including letting the block ride out) will by extension <i>do nothing</i> to curb real (or even perceived) issues that <i>many</i> editors have with Winkelvi. It would be irresponsible for those defending Winkelvi to set him up for this future failure that will (read: will) invariably (read dramatically: in-fucking-variably) result in a future indefinite block or community ban. I am concerned, however, that 0RR will only stop edit-warring and not anything else. I cannot think of a valid remedy for the issues of battlegrounding and harrassment (wikihounding) presented above. Indeed the most common remedy for these behaviours is an eventual indefinite block. To be blunt, I would support an indefinite community ban for a furthered instance of wikihounding, harrassment, or abuse. For the time being I cannot because at some point the statute of limitations has to be applied. For me, it is too late to be bringing a spate from 2 or more years ago as evidence. This statute is subject to my subjective interpretation of events. As far as I am concerned, edit-warring is not solved by indefinite blocks, but, by editing restrictions whether P/TBAN in instances where edit-warring can be linked to topics or pages, or, 1RR and 0RR where edit-warring is pervasive and widespread and not limited to a page or topic. I would have to demand a strong case be presented (separately from this display) to act or recommend an action over wikihounding and harrassment.<br />
Unrelatedly, I found certain behaviours displayed here by involved and uninvolved editors to be quite poor and worthy of reprimand themselves (trout or warning only; even though some of it is block worthy). DHeyward is not wrong to call this thread "caustic" especially when considering some of the behaviour displayed here. It has left me with a quite sour taste because some editors that I do respect have participated in this. This I find unfortunate. <a href="/wiki/User:Mr_rnddude" title="User:Mr rnddude">Mr rnddude</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Mr_rnddude" title="User talk:Mr rnddude">talk</a>) 07:33, 22 March 2017 (UTC)</li>

<li>Re "statute of limitations": the two-year-old disputes are relevant in demonstrating how the same issues have persisted over the years (edit-warring/tendentious editing on active vs. passive voice at Myerson in Jan. 2015; and edit warring/tendentiousness over active vs, passive voice at <a href="/wiki/Billy_the_Kid" title="Billy the Kid">Billy the Kid</a> in March 2017 and talk-page time stamps in Sept. 2016). Yes, threads are caustic. Why? Because editors are only human, and it seems to those of us who have dealt with him (who are not administrators he has cultivated) that Winkelvi is viewed by his defenders as an object of compassion and the community just has to suck it up and endure him. As I indicated above, that is <i>not</i> the approach that has been taken in very similar situations in the past, including one that I'm personally acquainted with and discuss directly above. <a href="/wiki/User:Coretheapple" title="User:Coretheapple">Coretheapple</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Coretheapple" title="User talk:Coretheapple">talk</a>) 13:03, 22 March 2017 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, threads are not caustic. <i>This</i> thread is caustic and it became caustic because of the participants on it. The causticism has nothing to do with the subject matter; case in point, Winkelvi has not said so much as a syllable (to be put on this thread) for the duration of this discussion. You could deflect this to the "defenders" of Winkelvi, and indeed you'd be half right, but, you'd also be half-wrong. A positive and a negative have no net value. This thread would be less than 1/10th of it's current length if editors were not swiping shots at each other in replies and instead made their case and then left - as I will proceed to do so from here on out - and accepted whatever outcome as that would be, by definition, community enforced. You may respond if you wish and I will read the response. Don't take this as me just knocking the table over and saying "I'm out". This thread is unique to me (despite my participation in possibly a hundred such threads) in that there are three separate "extended content" closes of unproductive (inflammatory even) commentary between editors that were required to re-rail the discussion. As for my statute of limitations, I have one question to be self-answered and the net result is the same. Were these dealt with at the time? if no then the statute has expired for me and I won't take it into any consideration unless they detail something especially egregious (harrasment for example), if yes then double jeopardy/time served whichever the case. Escalation does not mean relitigation. Besides, I am supporting any action taken (because some action should be taken) and I personally <b>recommend indefinite 0RR</b> to end the issue of edit-warring. <a href="/wiki/User:Mr_rnddude" title="User:Mr rnddude">Mr rnddude</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Mr_rnddude" title="User talk:Mr rnddude">talk</a>) 14:54, 22 March 2017 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, I guess it would be preferable if people were more succinct and pleasant, but that tends not to happen when people are trying to describe tendentious editing to third parties who don't always ooze empathy and sometimes are belittling. It also reflects the wide swath cut by an editor with 25,000 edits, five years on the project and recurrent issues. As a point of comparison, this ANI has only gone on for five days. The <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive871">2015 Winkelvi case, scroll down to Item 26 here</a>, involved identical issues, was far longer and more acrimonious than this one, and dragged on for <i>twenty</i> days. <a href="/wiki/User:Coretheapple" title="User:Coretheapple">Coretheapple</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Coretheapple" title="User talk:Coretheapple">talk</a>) 15:04, 22 March 2017 (UTC)</li>

Personally, if I was a neutral uninvolved administrator trying to make a decision here, I would have Winkelvi sit out the full 90-day block followed by an indefinite 0 RR. It would seem to be the best way to find a middle ground between those calling for an indefinite block or community ban and those calling for a 1 RR, while also satisfying all those who want a 0 RR. <a href="/wiki/User:Display_name_99" title="User:Display name 99">Display name 99</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Display_name_99" title="User talk:Display name 99">talk</a>) 14:11, 22 March 2017 (UTC)</li>

Consider a newbie adding something factually correct but full of puffery and weasel words; is Winkelvi violating 0RR by removing that puffery and stripping it back to the bare facts? However, when I proposed 1RR, I put a pretty clear stipulation that a) it was forever and b) on the <i>first</i> violation he would be booted off and not be allowed back without taking the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:OFFER" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:OFFER">standard offer</a>, which appears to have not been mentioned so much in this thread. <a href="/wiki/User:Ritchie333" title="User:Ritchie333"><b style="color:#7F007F">Ritchie333</b></a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ritchie333" title="User talk:Ritchie333"><sup style="color:#7F007F">(talk)</sup></a> <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Ritchie333" title="Special:Contributions/Ritchie333"><sup style="color:#7F007F">(cont)</sup></a> 17:42, 22 March 2017 (UTC)

<dd><a href="/wiki/User:Ritchie333" title="User:Ritchie333">Ritchie333</a>, if Winkelvi was to be placed on a 0RR and happened to see an edit adding factually incorrect material, he could either wait for somebody else to revert it or ping the editor as part of a POLITE message on the article's talk page. I just don't think we can trust Winkelvi after hitting the revert button once to not do it again if his reversion is reverted, while claiming vandalism or whatever else he can think up to excuse his behavior. <a href="/wiki/User:Display_name_99" title="User:Display name 99">Display name 99</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Display_name_99" title="User talk:Display name 99">talk</a>) 19:44, 22 March 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Endorse block</b></s><u><b>extend up to six month block, and no appeal before three months have passed</b></u> per prior experience with this editor. That experience had nothing to do with edit warring (interaction with a COI editor who wasn't editing mainspace anyway), but everything with Winkelvi's rude talk page behaviour. Transforming the sanction to 0RR/1RR would only address part of the problem. This sheds a new light on Winkelvi's "... Aspergers ... please leave me a civil message ... Being rude will get you nowhere." – hadn't seen that caveat at the time (maybe it wasn't there yet), but this is for me a deal breaker: it seems to suggest that they want to appropriate some sort of "right to be rude" (under the protection of "hey, I have autism spectrum so you can expect me to be rude") but won't treat others on the same footing. Accidentally I meet quite some people with autism spectrum, ADHD, ADD,... IRL. Some of them may be generally ruder in their interactions than others (who, for instance, may be extremely shy): however, for finding a place in society it <i>never</i> helps them to suggest that they should expect society to adapt to how they prefer their interactions with it. The Wikipedia editing community is such a society: Aspergers should never be an argument in how an editor wants to tailor their interactions with that community. So the message the Wikipedia community should be sending here is that behavioural guidelines apply the same to everyone. When Winkelvi returns to editing (if they have Aspergers there is little doubt that they will return to editing imho), further infringements on behavioural guidelines should be addressed with escalating blocks (which thus may be something in the order of magnitude of six months next time). --<a href="/wiki/User:Francis_Schonken" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Francis_Schonken" title="User talk:Francis Schonken">talk</a>) 16:16, 22 March 2017 (UTC) Updated&#160;!vote, see below.00:26, 23 March 2017 (UTC)</li>

I ask because there seems to be sentiment to wrap things up.

<dd>Issuing specific behavioural strictures <i>à la tête du client</i> kind of beats the purpose of sending the message "that behavioural guidelines apply the same to everyone" (which I would prefer – see above). Wrapping this up once and for all—wouldn't that be nice...—may be impractical: either Winkelvi is given a positive chance to exhibit better behaviour next time, no more encumbered than by a block log which needs not to be mentioned again when their behaviour turns for the better, or face a chain of appeals and counter-appeals draining community resources.</dd>
<dd>Re. "... no confidence that administrators will [do or not do whatever in the future]" – not the topic here. I'm not an admin but respect their discretionary powers. While an admin would take the flak for installing a pre-emptive measure of this kind, that admin would also be issuing a vote of no-confidence in their own kind for their inability to address a future situation which may or may not occur. Thus I'd advise any admin not to react with such pre-emptive measures. --<a href="/wiki/User:Francis_Schonken" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Francis_Schonken" title="User talk:Francis Schonken">talk</a>) 18:25, 22 March 2017 (UTC)

<dd>Sure it's one of the topics here. It has to be. We are here in a discussion commenced by the blocking admin, Coffee. Winkelvi pinged a bunch of administrators after he was blocked, and the pinged admins proceeded to roast Coffee over an open spit. Coffee held his ground and came here. Winkelvi himself has attacked the editors here as "liars" but declined to actually say what "lies" have been told about him, which not one admin has challenged on his page. So yes, indubitably, the prospect of Winkelvi resorting to such tactics in the future, and admins showing empathy toward him and not toward people with whom he comes into conflict, is definitely on the minds of non-admin editors he has encountered in the past. 0RR, 1RR and possible talk page methods are not designed to tie the hands of administrators, however. The point simply is to act now, rip the <a href="/wiki/Bandaid" class="mw-redirect" title="Bandaid">bandaid</a> off the skin so to speak, enact measures so that we won't be back here again. <a href="/wiki/User:Coretheapple" title="User:Coretheapple">Coretheapple</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Coretheapple" title="User talk:Coretheapple">talk</a>) 20:08, 22 March 2017 (UTC)

<dd>I'd be more worried about the (implied) canvassing, and the name-calling, during the current proceedings than about what might or might not happen in the future (and about how hypothetics might reflect on admins). Looking a bit more into the current case (my first reflection was primarily based on a previous experience) I'm updating my preference to six month block. I still feel less inclined (but strictly speaking not opposed) to 0RR/1RR kind of accompanying measures: if they would edit-war again that would call for appropriate measures, even before 3RR is trespassed. I'd appreciate if the closure of this thread (and the notification to Winkelvi when it gets closed) would mention they need to take a close look at the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring" title="Wikipedia:Edit warring">Wikipedia:edit warring</a> guidance again: that it can be detected way before a technical 3RR violation, and that editors should live up to it.

<p>We have a very extreme range in the&#160;!votes on this entire thread, from "immediate unblock with limited-term 1RR restriction", to "indef block". I propose a compromise: <b>Three-month block followed by indefinite 0RR, appealable in six months if no talkpage <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:BLUDGEONING" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:BLUDGEONING">WP:BLUDGEONING</a> has occurred.</b> In other words, the current three-month block remains in place, followed by an indefinite <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:0RR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:0RR">WP:0RR</a> restriction. The 0RR restriction may be appealed here at ANI after six months (six months after the block expires). If no talkpage <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:BLUDGEONING" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:BLUDGEONING">WP:BLUDGEONING</a> has occurred during that time, the 0RR restriction may be either lifted or replaced with a 1RR restriction. <a href="/wiki/User:Softlavender" title="User:Softlavender">Softlavender</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Softlavender" title="User talk:Softlavender">talk</a>) 01:37, 23 March 2017 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To Figureofnine and BMK: The proposal explicitly states (in bold) that the current three-month block is retained. If you support the proposal as written, that is a given. If you support it with changes, or support something else, then that would need to be stated in your&#160;!vote. <a href="/wiki/User:Softlavender" title="User:Softlavender">Softlavender</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Softlavender" title="User talk:Softlavender">talk</a>) 02:38, 23 March 2017 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My point to Figureofnine, is that, while I could well be wrong, I cannot recall the forced imposition of a non-appeallable block, although if Winkelvi were to agree to not being allowed to appeal the block, that would be a different matter. <a href="/wiki/User:Beyond_My_Ken" title="User:Beyond My Ken">Beyond My Ken</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Beyond_My_Ken" title="User talk:Beyond My Ken">talk</a>) 03:59, 23 March 2017 (UTC)

<dd>A non-appealable period of a block is possible, as it would be for any sanction, but not the entire block duration, except in the case of TP abuse.

<dd>BMK, I totally hear you on that, and various people in the thread have advocated a 1RR restriction. But the concern repeatedly voiced that 1RR merely allows edit-warring to be spread out more slowly, and the overwhelming number of "indef block"&#160;!votes, caused me to propose a situation where the concerns of the "indef block"&#160;!voters and the "0RR"&#160;!voters would be covered. <a href="/wiki/User:Softlavender" title="User:Softlavender">Softlavender</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Softlavender" title="User talk:Softlavender">talk</a>) 02:38, 23 March 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Support</b> - in short; I have advocated for 0RR above and I fully and absolutely agree that the block should not be lifted.

<dd>I hear you, Ritchie, but as others have observed several times, 1RR will not stop Winkelvi from edit-warring (nor from talk-page bludgeoning); it will only slow him down on the edit-warring, and will not stop talk-page bludgeoning at all. Also, there is enormous support for an indef block, and therefore I believe a 1RR proposal, even an indefinite one, will be very unlikely to gain consensus. Whereas a proposal that meets everyone's concerns can easily gain consensus and avoid an indef block. <a href="/wiki/User:Softlavender" title="User:Softlavender">Softlavender</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Softlavender" title="User talk:Softlavender">talk</a>) 07:48, 23 March 2017 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>0RR will probably <i>increase</i> talk page bludgeoning. I believe the effect will be similar to The Rambling Man's talk page when he was briefly blocked, which might as well have had a redirect of <a href="/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:ERRORS2&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Wikipedia:ERRORS2 (page does not exist)">WP:ERRORS2</a>. <a href="/wiki/User:Ritchie333" title="User:Ritchie333"><b style="color:#7F007F">Ritchie333</b></a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ritchie333" title="User talk:Ritchie333"><sup style="color:#7F007F">(talk)</sup></a> <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Ritchie333" title="Special:Contributions/Ritchie333"><sup style="color:#7F007F">(cont)</sup></a> 13:59, 23 March 2017 (UTC)

<dd>There are editors who spend days, weeks or months not reverting. I'm sure there are editors who have never reverted. There are hundreds if not thousands of articles that have never had a single revert. If Winkelvi can't control his talk page behavior, if he needs an outlet in reverting, then he should be indefinitely blocked. <a href="/wiki/User:Coretheapple" title="User:Coretheapple">Coretheapple</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Coretheapple" title="User talk:Coretheapple">talk</a>) 14:08, 23 March 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Support</b> as the best feasible option. I thank Softlavender for wading through all this, finding the common ground and for proposing a solution that will achieve two important things that are loud and clear in this discussion: a) the need for long-term consequences accruing to Winklevi for his edit warring and; b) the need for a very short rope where Winlevi's <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:BATTLEGROUND" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:BATTLEGROUND">WP:BATTLEGROUND</a> behavior is concerned. --<a href="/wiki/User:Drmargi" title="User:Drmargi">Drmargi</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Drmargi" title="User talk:Drmargi">talk</a>) 11:14, 23 March 2017 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b> - although I don't really care if the block remains as long as the 0RR is put in place. <a href="/wiki/User:Ealdgyth" title="User:Ealdgyth">Ealdgyth</a> - <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ealdgyth" title="User talk:Ealdgyth">Talk</a> 12:55, 23 March 2017 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b> I think this proposal works. The block should not be subject to lifting except by community agreement here, and Winkelvi should be warned against canvassing, as he has done for years whenever he gets in a jam. Canvassing specifically defined as pinging. We are here because of canvassing, which resulted in the mess on his talk page and the mess here. Thanks to Coffee for holding firm on the block and to Softlavender for this compromise proposal. <a href="/wiki/User:Coretheapple" title="User:Coretheapple">Coretheapple</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Coretheapple" title="User talk:Coretheapple">talk</a>) 13:28, 23 March 2017 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b> - I actually proposed the exact same thing a few days ago somewhere in this mess of a thread.<a href="/wiki/User:TheGracefulSlick" title="User:TheGracefulSlick">TheGracefulSlick</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:TheGracefulSlick" title="User talk:TheGracefulSlick">talk</a>) 13:43, 23 March 2017 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b> This is an editor whose zeal too often overmatches his judgment. That's been hard on a lot of members of the community and has sucked up a lot of time and electrons. But, the long history here still argues for trying to reach some reasonable accommodation. We may never think of a true vandal as a member of our community. But Winkelvi is demonstrably not a vandal and <b>is</b> a member of our community, however vexing his behavior sometimes may be. Taking one more shot at retaining his contributions while ameliorating the drama, a shot embodied in this proposed compromise, seems to me a risk worth taking. <a href="/wiki/User:David_in_DC" title="User:David in DC">David in DC</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:David_in_DC" title="User talk:David in DC">talk</a>) 16:38, 23 March 2017 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b> - per my two comments above. This is an editor shown above to have multiple long-term issues aside from blatant edit-warring, including massive edit stalking and abuse of AfD to vindictively get back at other editors. This is an editor hostile to those who dare to disagree with him and one who simply believes they are never wrong, except when they are about to be sanctioned. The admin canvassing alone is reprehensible. If you don't indef now, we will be having this same time sink of a process down the road. I see plenty of support for an indef above. The long history of problems with this editor should end here and now, instead of kicking the can down the road. <a href="/wiki/User:Jusdafax" title="User:Jusdafax"><font color="green">Jus</font></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jusdafax" title="User talk:Jusdafax"><font color="#C1118C">da</font></a><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Jusdafax" title="Special:Contributions/Jusdafax"><font color="#0000FF">fax</font></a> 16:57, 23 March 2017 (UTC)</li>

<dd><a href="/wiki/User:Jusdafax" title="User:Jusdafax">Jusdafax</a>, I'm with you here. But unfortunately we don't have consensus for an indefinite block or community ban. Too many people voted in this thread who either a) are Winkelvi's allies or b) have never been victimized by him and who don't know how severe the behavior is. I think that this solution is clearly the best we can get. As I said below, I hope (and am confident, I might add) that if we end up back here in less than a year's time because of Winkelvi's inappropriate behavior that we can finally get rid of him. <a href="/wiki/User:Display_name_99" title="User:Display name 99">Display name 99</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Display_name_99" title="User talk:Display name 99">talk</a>) 19:21, 23 March 2017 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: Canvassing is one issue, but there's more I'm curious about as one of his battered and banned victims. How can an editor who hadn't edited <i>anything</i> at Commons for at least the previous year, be able to <a class="external text" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commons:Administrators%27_noticeboard/User_problems&amp;oldid=227759988#Light_show_and_copyvios">post a message</a> to the Commons AN and within an hour get numerous primary editors there supporting him: ie. having them speedy delete w/o notice multiple images, opening a major discussion and succeed in getting me indeffed on a near technicality? Besides pinging other Commons editors who rushed to his side, he kept referring to me as a "she," when he knew I wasn't and had been reminded a number of times to knock it off. One Commons editor even <a class="external text" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Light_show#Nonsense_block">retracted his "nonsense" block</a>. BTW, has he ever apologized for the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/images/1200*675/massive+pileup+lead+image.jpg">wreckages</a> he's left us with? --<a href="/wiki/User:Light_show" title="User:Light show">Light show</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Light_show" title="User talk:Light show">talk</a>) 20:40, 23 March 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Support</b> as a reasonable reflection of the community's loss of patience with this editor. I would prefer that the block be replaced by the 0RR restriction immediately, rather than forcing a three-month wait to see whether Winkelvi intends to abide by the restriction or not. If we've decided that 0RR is the appropriate restriction then the block is no longer preventative. I prefer 1RR for reasons I've stated earlier but will not oppose on that basis. <a href="/wiki/User:Ivanvector" title="User:Ivanvector">Ivanvector</a> (<sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ivanvector" title="User talk:Ivanvector">Talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Ivanvector" title="Special:Contributions/Ivanvector">Edits</a></sub>) 17:35, 23 March 2017 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b> - Winklevi would do well to heed his own advice - "Edit warring is not just violating 3RR, it is also a behavior...", which came from <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RRArchive325#User:TL565_reported_by_User:Winkelvi_.28Result:_Meh.29">this EW report from 6 months ago noted above</a>, WV also drops this policy reminder from <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:EW" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:EW">WP:EW</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:3RR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:3RR">WP:3RR</a> into that discussion: <i>Even without a 3RR violation, an administrator may still act if they believe a user's behavior constitutes edit warring, and any user may report edit warring with or without 3RR being breached. The rule is not an entitlement to revert a page a specific number of times.</i> And when he is accused of having "a lengthy history of edit warring" in that discussion, he responds with - <i>Precisely why I know what I'm talking about</i>. So in my opinion, WV knew he was edit warring in this instance for which he was blocked, and since he acknowledges his lengthy history of edit warring, it should come as no surprise to him that there was an escalation in this block. I also believe Coffee's block was justified and endorse it as well. <a href="/wiki/User:Isaidnoway" title="User:Isaidnoway"><font face="Times New Roman" color="blue"><i><b>Isaidnoway</b></i></font></a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Isaidnoway" title="User talk:Isaidnoway"><font face="Times New Roman" color="blue"><i><b>(talk)</b></i></font></a> 18:17, 23 March 2017 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b>-This is clearly the best we can get out of this discussion. My hope is that if we end up back here any time within the next year or so because Winkelvi continues to cause trouble, we can get consensus for an indefinite block or community ban. But for now I'll settle with this. <a href="/wiki/User:Display_name_99" title="User:Display name 99">Display name 99</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Display_name_99" title="User talk:Display name 99">talk</a>) 19:21, 23 March 2017 (UTC) I also think that if a significant (or increased) amount of talk page bludgeoning occurs during this restriction that it could be enough for indefinite block, as opposed to merely not lifting the restriction. <a href="/wiki/User:Display_name_99" title="User:Display name 99">Display name 99</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Display_name_99" title="User talk:Display name 99">talk</a>) 20:12, 23 March 2017 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm a vegetarian. A news story this week has been on <a href="/wiki/Memphis_Meats" title="Memphis Meats">Memphis Meats</a>, who are vat-growing animal cells to make a "meat".

<dl>
<dd>In return I get this, <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Andy_Dingley#Hounding.2C_again" title="User talk:Andy Dingley">User talk:Andy Dingley#Hounding, again</a>, and now here.</dd>
<dd>I am <i>sick</i> of Jytdog's behaviour to any number of other GF editors, particularly new editors. His history speaks for itself. He also has a <i>very</i> thin skin, if he calls a disagreement on an article talk page "hounding". And no Jytdog, I didn't "follow you" to that article, I'm a vegetarian (and have often mentioned this) and I'm interested in vat-grown meat news. We are both editors who have been here some years: yet it was <i>you</i> who opened an SPI on <i>me</i>, even after you'd said you wouldn't do such a ridiculous thing. Let alone awarding me a "<a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Berylliosis&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=712892011">moron diploma</a>".</dd>
<dd>As an editor who does "good work" in rigorously enforcing MEDRS, Jytdog has some powerful friends. So a few months back I was even blocked by one of those admins for <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Edit_warring&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=749204801">pointing out at ANEW</a>, also <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Andy_Dingley&amp;oldid=749253660#Hounding">Talk:</a>, that 4RR was a brightline block, even for Jytdog. An admin who then ignored my requests to discuss this. Now you appear to be conflating me with <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive948#Vipul.27s_paid_editing_enterprise" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive948">a paid editing scheme</a> - is there <i>any</i> valid reason to bring that up here, or to attempt to connect me to it, or are you just flinging mud?</dd>

<dd>You are really not taking the time to understand.

The two editors with whom I was talking, both edit EA topics as you can see from their contribs and I have already started interacting with them on other articles as part of the cleanup of Vipul's enterprise before discussions happened at this article. Vipul's entire enterprise was EA driven, if you take a few minutes and actually read the links and I anticipate there will be further issues with the already present EA advocates in WP as that cleanup continues. You are not even trying to understand what you stepped into the middle of in your hounding of me and canvassing of a newbie editor. The latter is especially bad form as you are actively trying to screw up the head of a newbie. <a href="/wiki/User:Jytdog" title="User:Jytdog">Jytdog</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jytdog" title="User talk:Jytdog">talk</a>) 00:22, 19 March 2017 (UTC)

<dd>Jytdog, as I've <i>already</i> told you, I'm a veggie so I'm interested in vat-grown meat and Memphis Meat (which you've been pruning as NOTNEWS) has been all over my newsfeeds this week.

Your pattern of hounding me and making messes is clear. <b>And even if what you are saying is true, given that history and your already having been blocked once for hounding me, you should have restrained yourself, but you didn't.</b> So you walked right into this, either way.

<dd>It is not part of the Vipul paid enterprise. I didn't say it was. It is part of the EA advocacy that has gone in WP, which Vipul's enterprise falls within, and which we are going to run into a lot from non-Vipul affiliated editors, as we go to clean up after the Vipul enterprise. (The Memphis Meats article fits into the EA universe b/c one of the EA movement's targets is alleviating animal suffering; Memphis Meats aims to grow meat in vats, from cells, solving the problem with technology.) The MM article was <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Memphis_Meats&amp;oldid=703383230">created</a> by a sockpuppet of an EA advocate as shown <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/Davidcpearce/Archive">here</a>.

<dd>Argh. I first encountered Kbog when I was cleaning up <a href="/wiki/Giving_What_We_Can" title="Giving What We Can">Giving What We Can</a>, which is an article that the Vipul editors worked on. Kbog at first fought the clean up. In discussions with Kbog on their Talk page, Utsill joined in. In that discussion at Kbog's Talk page, Kbog started understanding the problem Ustill did not. Then Utsill added promotional content to Memphis Meats, which I reverted, and that started a conflict at <b>that</b> EA advocate article. Which Kbog had just about resolved, when Andy brought his BATTLEGROUND with me there, complicating the problem. Like I said already, there is a set of EA advocates and we are going to keep running into them at other EA-related articles. The Vipul set of EA articles is a subset of the EA articles in WP. <a href="/wiki/User:Jytdog" title="User:Jytdog">Jytdog</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jytdog" title="User talk:Jytdog">talk</a>) 09:06, 21 March 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The thing is, if you are requesting a one-way IBan with someone you need to immediately make your case, with sufficient probative diffs, that the other person is stalking, hounding, and/or harassing you. Anything else is irrelevant, particularly when it is lengthy and stated in such a way that the interpretation of it is liable to be incorrect. I'm not an admin and I'm not deciding this case, but my recommendation would be for Andy to take Jytdog's talk-page off his watchlist and to stop tracking his edits and other people's mentions of him, and if this gets brought up here at ANI again there will probably be a one-way IBan enacted (if it is not enacted now). <a href="/wiki/User:Softlavender" title="User:Softlavender">Softlavender</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Softlavender" title="User talk:Softlavender">talk</a>) 00:01, 22 March 2017 (UTC)

The case stated concisely is as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Andy originally got angry with me over the <a href="/wiki/RepRap_project" title="RepRap project">RepRap project</a> kerfluffle that was blogged about off-wiki in March 2016 (see that wonderfully titled ANI thread <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive917#Rude_vulgarian_editor">Rude vulgarian editor</a> where Andy latched on) That case involved an SPI into the filer CaptainYuge (<a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/CaptainYuge/Archive" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/CaptainYuge/Archive">here</a>) who was found to have an alt account, used legitimately, but was not running the disruptive account that was mentioned there.</li>
<li>Around that same time, two (!) people unrelated to RepRap or Andy started a sock-driven harassment campaign against me and some other folks, which were (after a big mess of sorting) were filed under <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/Renameduser024/Archive" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Renameduser024/Archive">Renameduser024</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/Biscuittin/Archive" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Biscuittin/Archive">Biscuittin</a>. Biscuittin played games with some of their many socks, and in one of them, did some things that made them look just like Andy acting disruptively toward me, which led to the SPI Andy still complains about <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/Andy_Dingley/Archive" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Andy Dingley/Archive">here</a>.</li>
<li>Anyway in March 2016 Andy took to harassing me at an other article Talk page, writing (among other things) <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABerylliosis&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=712866210&amp;oldid=712844409">this</a> where he led in with <span class="inline-quote-talk" style="font-family: Georgia, 'DejaVu Serif', serif; color: #008560;">: How did your "disparage every editor and every source, despite knowing nothing about the subject" strategy work for you on <a href="/wiki/RepRap_project" title="RepRap project">RepRap project</a>? Maybe you'll get <i>three</i> adverse media mentions for Wikipedia this time round?</span> and went on from there with similar remarks, which I warned him about per <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Andy_Dingley&amp;oldid=716845395#Article_talk_pages.2C_WP:NPA">this</a> and <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Andy_Dingley&amp;oldid=716745112#Please_don.27t_edit_within_other_users_comments_at_ANI">this</a>, and you can see other links there.</li>
<li>In April he interfered with ongoing SPIs into the Biscuittin matter by interjecting snark and distraction as you can see <a class="external text" href="https://tools.wmflabs.org/sigma/usersearch.py?name=Andy+Dingley&amp;page=Wikipedia%3ASockpuppet_investigations%2FBiscuittin&amp;server=enwiki&amp;max=">here</a> and some of his hounding comments (and my responses to them) there were finally reverted by an admin <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ASockpuppet_investigations%2FBiscuittin&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=716292987&amp;oldid=716033000">here</a>). I warned him away from doing that <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Andy_Dingley&amp;oldid=716745112#Unhelpful">here</a>.</li>
<li>In April I launched an AfD at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Barack_the_Magic_Negro" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Barack the Magic Negro">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Barack the Magic Negro</a> - Andy was the first to&#160;!vote (against the nomination, of course) and was out of sync with the community again. He had <a class="external text" href="https://tools.wmflabs.org/sigma/usersearch.py?name=Andy+Dingley&amp;page=Barack_the_Magic_Negro&amp;server=enwiki&amp;max=">never</a> edited the article before - This is really obvious and active stalking)</li>

<li>He then left me alone for a while.</li>

<li>In November, after an advocate who was edit warring promotional, COPYVIO content into an article about a law school left <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJytdog&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=749209054&amp;oldid=749203031">retaliatory</a> note on my page, Andy jumped into the EWN discussion with personal attacks that had nothing to do with the matter at hand <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Edit_warring&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=749204801">here</a> I warned them about that <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Andy_Dingley&amp;oldid=749253660#Hounding">here</a> and he was <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/block&amp;page=User%3AAndy+Dingley">blocked</a> for 31 hours over that, (<a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=prev&amp;oldid=749253660">block notice</a>).</li>
<li>What prompts this filing is that i was in midst of working to remove advocacy from another article related to <a href="/wiki/Effective_altruism" title="Effective altruism">effective altruism</a>, and was working with two editors with a history of EA advocacy editing (as you can see from their contribs (<a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions/Utsill&amp;offset=&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Utsill">here for Utsill</a> and <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions/Kbog&amp;offset=&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Kbog">here for Kbog</a>) who were arguing to keep the promotional content. One of the two, Utsill, left <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJytdog&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=770919423&amp;oldid=770900740">a notice</a> on my talk page. And Andy, who had never before edited the article or its talk page (<a class="external text" href="https://tools.wmflabs.org/sigma/usersearch.py?name=Andy+Dingley&amp;page=Memphis_Meats&amp;server=enwiki&amp;max=">user-search at article</a>, <a class="external text" href="https://tools.wmflabs.org/sigma/usersearch.py?name=Andy+Dingley&amp;page=Talk%3AMemphis_Meats&amp;max=500&amp;server=enwiki">user-search at talk page</a>) jumped in and of course included commentary directed at me, like <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Memphis_Meats&amp;curid=49348127&amp;diff=770967793&amp;oldid=770967542">this</a>.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Andy's action here was particularly galling, because a) Kbog, who is becoming reasonable, had proposed a decent compromise when Andy stomped in and blew it up; and b) Andy's action only inflamed Utsill, who was especially strongly resisting removing promotionalism from this article; and c) we are starting to clean up a bunch of EA advocacy articles related to another matter, and I am concerned about this pattern of behavior continuing, especially on the EA stuff.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The pattern is clear. Andy sees a notice on my talk page, and goes to where the dispute is and jumps in, making difficult situations worse. I am now requesting an Iban. I have had enough of him interjecting his confused anger into SPIs and already-difficult discussions I often have with advocates in WP.

I have seen <a href="/wiki/User:Jytdog" title="User:Jytdog">User:Jytdog</a> brought here a lot, whether it be by someone else or of his own accord, and he seems very argumentative, almost always seems like he's the one to initiate the tension in these kinds of incidents that could otherwise be solved easily. --<a href="/wiki/User:Yukari_Yakumo" title="User:Yukari Yakumo">Yukari Yakumo</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Yukari_Yakumo" title="User talk:Yukari Yakumo">talk</a>) 18:06, 22 March 2017 (UTC)</s></p>

<li>I've been watching this discussion for a while, and it looks to me like there is no chance for any kind of consensus to emerge from it. I'll offer some advice to both parties, take it or leave it. There probably will not be an IBAN at the request of one party or the other, but if the community gets annoyed by ongoing clashes, the community is likely to enact sanctions. Both Jytdog and Andy Dingley: it would be a good idea for both of you to voluntarily act as if there were a 2-way IBAN. Just do it voluntarily. If you see the other user somewhere, go somewhere else. If the other user shows up where you already are, go somewhere else anyway. Do not interact. Do not get concerned with "but he started it first". Do not get concerned with it being unfair if you have to stop editing somewhere that you would like to edit. Life is not fair. Wikipedia is not fair. And if a third-party editor sees more clashes and opens a new thread here, there will be a much more decisive result than what is happening here, and one or both of you won't like it. --<a href="/wiki/User:Tryptofish" title="User:Tryptofish">Tryptofish</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Tryptofish" title="User talk:Tryptofish">talk</a>) 19:27, 22 March 2017 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks Trypto. There is no evidence, at all, of me chasing after Andy - there is plenty of him hounding me. I don't <i>want</i> to interact with him. I will take away from this, that if he pursues me, I will act like I have an iban with him and not respond, and I will wait a very long while to bring another case if he continues doing this and nobody else stops him.

<p>On the mentioned page, I re-phrased a sentence where the Holodomor was written as "genocide", by removing such words such as "genocide" and "engineered" as this description was not neutral. As written in <a href="/wiki/Holodomor_genocide_question" title="Holodomor genocide question">Holodomor genocide question</a>, many historians and scholars do not believe that the Holodomor falls under the definition of "genocide", as well as there being no international consensus that the Holodomor was genocide. The genocide question still carries on to this day, and therefore, the sentence was not respecting neutrality, as writing that the Holodomor was "genocide" is favoring one side. As I changed this, Lute88 reverted the edit, and I replied with that the genocide label was still disputed, where he reverted my edit again, claiming that it wasn't disputed, and when I linked the user to the <a href="/wiki/Holodomor_genocide_question" title="Holodomor genocide question">Holodomor genocide question</a> page after editing again, he reverted the edit without giving an explanation, and kept doing so, yet again without reason, leaving me to presume that the user is simply ignoring facts that is presented to them. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/92.6.41.228" title="Special:Contributions/92.6.41.228">92.6.41.228</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:92.6.41.228" title="User talk:92.6.41.228">talk</a>) 21:27, 18 March 2017 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This does not 'delegitimise' the Holodomor - it is still mentioned without any sort of denial or questioning, and links to the Holodomor article, a better solution than giving a disputed label, as the edit was on the summary.

Also, you have falsely accused me of using an 'IP hopper' - falsely accusing someone on the spot is a form of cyberbullying on Wikipedia.

<p>As a preface, I take this action only after numerous attempts to help jytdog understand that there is no wp policy that prohibits discussion of primary sources.

<p>Jytdog removed my edit (the official diff is [<a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=770874073&amp;oldid=770868105">here</a>]) with the comment "zero MEDRS sources."</p>
<p>So, my question to you administrators is whether jytdog has the backing of the community to prevent me from citing current research. It appears to me from various discussions that his view is not the mainstream consensus view of the community on this issue, <b>and</b> he is not following official wp policy from <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:SCIRS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:SCIRS">WP:SCIRS</a> which specifically states "<b>Respect primary sources</b> A primary source... may be a valuable component of an article. A good article may appropriately cite primary, secondary, and tertiary sources. In addition, I feel that he is harrassing me by removing my edits, while not removing other material sourced to non-MEDRS sources.</p>
<p>Thus, I ask you to block jytdog from removing edits soley because they are based on primary sources. Note that I am not requesting a block from removing edits that are based on low quality primary sources. I strive to cite only papers published in highly respected journals. I'll save him the trouble and point out myself that I realize there is considerable discussion of the reproducability "crisis" in science, but unreliable sources can even find there way into reputable tertiary sources, as I learned and corrected <a href="/wiki/Talk:Mediator_(coactivator)#rollback_of_3.2F12.2F17" title="Talk:Mediator (coactivator)">here</a>. <small class="autosigned">—&#160;Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/wiki/User:DennisPietras" title="User:DennisPietras">DennisPietras</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:DennisPietras#top" title="User talk:DennisPietras">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/DennisPietras" title="Special:Contributions/DennisPietras">contribs</a>) 03:10, 19 March 2017 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>I think it was a mistake to move this from a policy noticeboard (VPP) to a behavioral noticeboard (this).

<p>The problem here is evident: These editors persist on irregularly reverting a closure via reverts, to the point that we have to discuss this here instead of my talk page or <a href="/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Adminstrators_noticeboard&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Wikipedia:Adminstrators noticeboard (page does not exist)">WP:Adminstrators noticeboard</a> itself. Closures should not be reverted if they aren't clear vandalism or similar. The reason is simple: If they could, then everyone could continue reverting until a closure is made they like, giving those editors who are more revert-happy an advantage. That is the reason why you must go via the closer's talk page and then ANI to get a consensus against the close, if it was indeed made in error. But the way these editors went is clearly disruptive to the process(but at least they don't seem to be bad faith actions).<a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/109.43.1.204" title="Special:Contributions/109.43.1.204">109.43.1.204</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:109.43.1.204" title="User talk:109.43.1.204">talk</a>) 11:38, 19 March 2017 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Consensus and longstanding precedent support closes of non-contentious discussions by non-administrator editors in good standing. Is this an editor in good standing? Who, having never apparently attempted to close a discussion before nor even participated in project space at all before yesterday, just happened to decide to try their hand at closing a huge discussion with likely disruptive implications (concerning what all users can and cannot post on their own user pages)? Or is it an editor who participated in the discussion and is logging out to try to force a close that favours their opinion? Or a banned editor trying to disrupt the project? I don't know, I have no idea and neither does anyone who looks at this now or reviews the discussion later, but judging the outcomes of such controversial discussions is not a good situation for assuming good faith. <a href="/wiki/User:Ivanvector" title="User:Ivanvector">Ivanvector</a> (<sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ivanvector" title="User talk:Ivanvector">Talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Ivanvector" title="Special:Contributions/Ivanvector">Edits</a></sub>) 12:20, 19 March 2017 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>And several editors have already observed that the close gives an air of bias, which I agree. Closes of controversial discussions where the motive of the closer is in question are not likely to be respected by the community. This should be re-closed by someone with a demonstrable history of closing controversial discussions. <a href="/wiki/User:Ivanvector" title="User:Ivanvector">Ivanvector</a> (<sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ivanvector" title="User talk:Ivanvector">Talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Ivanvector" title="Special:Contributions/Ivanvector">Edits</a></sub>) 12:30, 19 March 2017 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And what is exactly the reason for not discussing this with me and then, if necessary, at the noticeboard itself(as opposed to Incidents), but instead trying to force this by reverting? If you think that this decision really has an air of bias, then you can surely try to find and identify this bias and tell me or at least this venue what exactly is, in your opinion, the problem with this close. It does not create exceptional workload, it can show you that you imagine a bias that isn't there, or it can help in correcting the close and, if the case is indeed reopened, prevents a close that has these problems, if they indeed exist, to be made again. Reverting, on the other hand, does not help closing the debate at all. Experienced editors with an account and a history of good closings in controversial discussion apparently didn't close that discussion even when the debate slowed down, so I closed it instead. <small class="autosigned">—&#160;Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/109.43.1.119" title="Special:Contributions/109.43.1.119">109.43.1.119</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:109.43.1.119&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:109.43.1.119 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 13:27, 19 March 2017 (UTC)</small></dd>

<li>Then find those admins and registered users with long-time activity and very high experience, and ask them to help with those closures. If there were enough extremely experienced registered users closing discussions in a normal time, I would probably not close those discussions. It doesn't seem like that though.

<li>There is no good reason for me to revert that again anyways, we are discussing this right here. What I propose here is that the discussion is indeed reclosed, and that the complainants are directed to complain about the closure the usual way, and to use arguments in that discussion instead of unsourced and unexplained accusations like "It seems biased". However, someone else will look at this and decide, after the arguments come to a conclusion. So no, I won't revert again, but thanks for the warning. <small class="autosigned">—&#160;Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/109.43.0.140" title="Special:Contributions/109.43.0.140">109.43.0.140</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:109.43.0.140&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:109.43.0.140 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 15:53, 19 March 2017 (UTC)</small></li>

<p>and they conflict with <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Closing_discussions" title="Wikipedia:Closing discussions">WP:Closing discussions</a>, that sets the correct method of challenging closures; first discuss with the closer, and then, if necessary, go to <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:AN" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:AN">WP:AN</a>. Reverting closures without discussing and getting consensus at AN/with the author is wrong if there were any arguments provided beyond simple votecounting, and if the other usual exemptions don't apply(Vandalism, legal reasons...). There is a very good reason for all this: Reverting empowers editors to try to circumvent consensus until someone closes it the "right way", especially if consensus is determined to be with the minority of votes(because a large number of the majority votes were against policy/had no reasoning and/or core policies would be violated otherwise). <small class="autosigned">—&#160;Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/109.43.0.140" title="Special:Contributions/109.43.0.140">109.43.0.140</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:109.43.0.140&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:109.43.0.140 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 16:52, 19 March 2017 (UTC)</small></p>

On the contrary, it has been the IP who was edit warring.

<dd>And I have removed the passage in question, for several reasons. Essays and the like should not try to write policy, and there is as far as I can tell, nowhere in policy that says IPs can't close discussions. NACs are required to be non-controversial to begin with, and so, due to the presumably self-evident nature of the discussion and close, it shouldn't matter at all whether the editor is registered or not. If it <i>does matter</i> then it is probably not an uncontroversial close and thus probably shouldn't be an NAC regardless. In either circumstance the question of whether the editor is registered or not is immaterial.</dd>

<p>I have some concerns re the above user re apparent disregard to talk page notices regarding marking edits as minor, the first dating back to 2014, and the most recent being a bit more than a fortnight ago. The user is also now moving pages without consensus and no visible proof regarding the moves - I have (un)moved <a href="/wiki/Stadler_Eurolight" class="mw-redirect" title="Stadler Eurolight">Stadler Eurolight</a> to its original name of <a href="/wiki/Vossloh_Eurolight" title="Vossloh Eurolight">Vossloh Eurolight</a> as no proof was offered for the name, other than the summary "<i>factory ownership change</i>"; the main Vossloh article citing that ownership was changed but nothing saying branding would be too. I have a feeling that the user may be a sock of blocked user <a href="/wiki/User:D47817" title="User:D47817">D47817</a> but cannot find too many similarities other than inability to read their talk page and topic similarities. Would an uninvolved admin/experienced editor care to investigate and evaluate what action should be brought forward?

<dd>I think this is either incompetence or just blatant vandalism. Either way I think that the user should be prompted to respond, lest they banned from Wikipedia entirely should they continue to ignore warnings. I don't like to suggest banning right off the bat, but this seems like long-term nonsense going on and sanctioning should occur. <a href="/wiki/User:UNSC_Luke_1021" title="User:UNSC Luke 1021">UNSC Luke 1021</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:UNSC_Luke_1021" title="User talk:UNSC Luke 1021">talk</a>) 15:04, 20 March 2017 (UTC)

<dd>A block is needed here; from their contributions log, they know that their user talk exists since they removed a less than polite note from an editor asking what on earth Yh00157 was doing, and only a block will force this user to confront and discuss their problems which date back a number of years. Listing every single edit they make as minor when some are very much major changes is not helpful, but doing it for several years is a problem that requires a block. <a href="/wiki/User:Jcc" title="User:Jcc">jcc</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jcc#top" title="User talk:Jcc">tea and biscuits</a>) 17:48, 20 March 2017 (UTC)

</ul>
<p>The specific modifications I made to those pages, categorically-speaking, were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing the language family color from "Altaic" to "isolate"; I justified this change because of the discrediting of the Altaic language family.<sup id="cite_ref-Campbell_.26_Mixco_2007_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Campbell_.26_Mixco_2007-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Nichols_1992_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Nichols_1992-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Dixon_1997_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dixon_1997-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Pereltsvaig_2012_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Pereltsvaig_2012-4">[4]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Adding estimates of speaker populations and the relative accuracy of those estimates. I reached my estimates of estimated speakers for each dialect by using South Korean population data from 2014, North Korean population data from 2008, and Korean diaspora population estimates from 2015 (with regards to the proportions of dialect speakers in the diaspora, I admitted in my edit explanations that there is a substantial fudge factor involved; I estimated that within the diaspora, at least half spoke the Standard Korean/Gyeonggi dialect, maybe a quarter spoke the Gyeongsang dialect, and smaller proportions spoke the other dialects, I didn't attempt to reconcile these proportions with the large number of ethnic Koreans in the diaspora who can't speak Korean at all).</li>
</ul>
<p>I made assorted modifications to the pages (e.g. adding a "citation needed" tag for unsourced claims, etc.) as I saw fit.</p>
<p>At first, the individual doing the reverting left no explanation. When I left a note on that IP's talk page, I received subsequent responses in Korean. While I am fluent in Korean, I found it inappropriate that the editor, who may have little or no knowledge of English (which would explain the lack of explanation for the reverts), left a message on an English-language talk page almost entirely in Korean. At any rate, the rationale that individual gave for the reverts were as follows: 1) because the Turkish, Mongolian, and Manchu languages still use the Altaic family tag/color (these were formerly lumped together under the Altaic umbrella as the core grouping), this is valid for Korean (which, by the way, does not follow; only certain expanded versions of Altaic ever included Korean), and 2) province population estimates are not a valid surrogate for numbers of speakers of local dialects. I replied (in Korean) that the Altaic language family was discredited and thus the Turkish, Mongolian, and Manchu language family/color tags were also therefore incorrect, and that the point of <i>estimating</i> the number of speakers was not to obtain a highly accurate estimate but rather to provide a sense of relative scale of speaking population. The editor's response to my objection to the Altaic color/tag was that the use of the color was not necessarily an acceptance of the grouping (the references I provided evidently were sufficient for the author to concede that point) but for the sake of consistency.</p>
<p>My edits are sourced and corroborated in other references, and while I've asked for semi-protection for these pages to nip this revert war in the bud, some individuals have recommended that I bring this series of incidents here.<a href="/wiki/User:Ecthelion83" title="User:Ecthelion83">Ecthelion83</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ecthelion83" title="User talk:Ecthelion83">talk</a>) 16:30, 20 March 2017 (UTC)</p>
<ol>
<li>familycolor Altaic is not about an language family. It's just an areal classification along with Khoisan, Amerindian, Papuan, Australian, Caucasian, and Paleosiberian. See <a href="/wiki/Template:Infobox_language_family" title="Template:Infobox language family">Template:Infobox language family</a>.</li>
<li>There aren't any statistics about the linguistic demography published by the SK government. Ecthelion83 has misunderstood each SK province's population data as each dialect's population data. --<a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/117.53.77.84" title="Special:Contributions/117.53.77.84">117.53.77.84</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:117.53.77.84" title="User talk:117.53.77.84">talk</a>) 16:41, 20 March 2017 (UTC)</li>
<li>Using familycolor Altaic to the <a href="/wiki/Korean_language" title="Korean language">Korean language</a> was already accepted. See <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Korean_language&amp;diff=763974116&amp;oldid=763402072">1</a> and <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Korean_language&amp;diff=765405071&amp;oldid=765066152">2</a> --<a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/117.53.77.84" title="Special:Contributions/117.53.77.84">117.53.77.84</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:117.53.77.84" title="User talk:117.53.77.84">talk</a>) 16:57, 20 March 2017 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Note that the link for Altaic (areal) on <a href="/wiki/Template:Infobox_language_family" title="Template:Infobox language family">Template:Infobox language family</a> links to <a href="/wiki/Altaic_languages" title="Altaic languages">Altaic languages</a>. Again, the Altaic classification is discredited; we should begin discontinuing its use. There is no rationale on <a href="/wiki/Template:Infobox_language_family" title="Template:Infobox language family">Template:Infobox language family</a> that provides any sort of published authoritative documentation for the use of the Altaic tag in any form for Korean, only an exhortation that the language family tab be appropriate. The appropriate language classification for Korean at the moment is <a href="/wiki/Language_isolates#Asia" class="mw-redirect" title="Language isolates">language isolate</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Campbell_.26_Mixco_2007_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Campbell_.26_Mixco_2007-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Nichols_1992_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Nichols_1992-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Dixon_1997_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dixon_1997-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Pereltsvaig_2012_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Pereltsvaig_2012-4">[4]</a></sup> The one change by <a href="/wiki/User:Florian_Blaschke" title="User:Florian Blaschke">User:Florian Blaschke</a> is justified by "we use Altaic as a colour for the areal group" - it should be noted that he is a scholar in <a href="/wiki/Indo-European" class="mw-redirect" title="Indo-European">Indo-European</a> linguistics, and as far as we can tell he has no relationship to Korean, so it is unclear what he means by "we," and as he is not a primary researcher in Korean (and even if he was), he provides no published documentation for this arbitrary classification.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I haven't confused population data for speaking population; if you even read my original discussion here, you should note I am well aware of inaccuracies in making estimates as I did (but, since you clearly missed it, I repeat: the point of <i>estimating</i> the number of speakers was not to obtain a highly accurate estimate but rather to provide a sense of relative scale of speaking population; I am aware that a provincial population estimate does not necessarily translate into an accurate estimate of the number of speakers of thats province's local dialect - I just did a best-guess or "ballpark" estimate because those dialects' infoboxes lacked these numbers).<a href="/wiki/User:Ecthelion83" title="User:Ecthelion83">Ecthelion83</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ecthelion83" title="User talk:Ecthelion83">talk</a>) 17:22, 20 March 2017 (UTC)</li>

<ol>
<li>Altaic (areal) means the colour is just an areal classification, not about a language family. So there is no reason stopping to use it.</li>
<li>Population of each Province doesn't mean each dialect's population. For example, people from Western <a href="/wiki/South_Gyeongsang" class="mw-redirect" title="South Gyeongsang">South Gyeongsang</a> (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Jinju" title="Jinju">Jinju</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sacheon" title="Sacheon">Sacheon</a>) and Northern <a href="/wiki/North_Gyeongsang" class="mw-redirect" title="North Gyeongsang">North Gyeongsang</a> (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Andong" title="Andong">Andong</a>) use somewhat unique dialects. These dialects aren't as same as mainstream <a href="/wiki/Gyeongsang_dialect" title="Gyeongsang dialect">Gyeongsang dialect</a>. --<a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/117.53.77.84" title="Special:Contributions/117.53.77.84">117.53.77.84</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:117.53.77.84" title="User talk:117.53.77.84">talk</a>) 17:23, 20 March 2017 (UTC)</li>
<li>We don't have to fill in the gap about 'speakers'. --<a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/117.53.77.84" title="Special:Contributions/117.53.77.84">117.53.77.84</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:117.53.77.84" title="User talk:117.53.77.84">talk</a>) 17:33, 20 March 2017 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Again, even the areal classification for "Altaic" is questionable, as the entire hypothesis has been discredited.</li>
<li>You are just repeating what I have already noted. The Korean dialect pages refer to provincial-level variances in the spoken Korean language; I believe that the fact that a high degree of accuracy in the number of speakers is difficult to obtain (especially given the large size of the Korean diaspora) does not mean we should leave the estimated number of speakers in each dialect's infobox blank. In addition, for an estimate of speakers based on provincial population to be so inaccurate as to be invalid, the degree of permanent migration in and out of each province would have to be substantial, and as far as I know most migration within Korea is not of the permanent kind (with the exception of migration to Seoul and Busan), so using population estimates to partly approximate a number of speakers is reasonable. If anything, given the degree to which many Koreans can easily speak multiple dialects (usually one's home dialect plus Standard Korean, i.e. the Gyeonggi dialect spoken in Seoul), the number of speakers of some Korean dialects may exceed the population of the provinces from which they originate.<a href="/wiki/User:Ecthelion83" title="User:Ecthelion83">Ecthelion83</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ecthelion83" title="User talk:Ecthelion83">talk</a>) 17:38, 20 March 2017 (UTC)</li>
<li>I should add that the other editor's rationales do not justify mass reverting behavior.

<li><b>Take a breath</b> Folks, this is clearly a content dispute and Administrators are unlikely to pick sides. Have you tried discussing the changes on the Talk page of the article? If so, your next step should be to start a Request for Comment discussion on the talk page. If that fails, Dispute Resolution is the next step. I'm not sure who advised you to bring this here, but it wasn't the best advice they could have given you: having a very public content dispute on this page will probably end badly for everyone involved.

<p>The Korean user is probably a korean internet nationalist, he will not stop his edits and his ignorant behavior. Maybe he will even start to call us Chinese or Japanese "agents". It woulb be great to block him for some days or longer. Maybe you writte him also in korean if he do not understand english. This topic was already discussed and the result was to support the remove of the altaic color classification at least on korean and japanese, but also one the former members of core-altaic. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/213.162.68.186" title="Special:Contributions/213.162.68.186">213.162.68.186</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:213.162.68.186" title="User talk:213.162.68.186">talk</a>) 18:36, 20 March 2017 (UTC)</p>

<p>This two ip adresses edit/vandalise the same pages. He ignore all discussion pages and questions. He refuse to give a explanation. It seems that he can not even speak english.</p>
<p>Especially on japonic languages and related pages; on koreanic and related pages and on ainu language.</p>
<p>He is using unenzyclopedic way.</p>

<p>The user 117.53.77.84 get already blocked 4th times. Also I and other users have said him that the altaic classification for japanese and korean is obsolete. This was already discussed and the result was to support the deletion of altaic colour at least by japonic and koreanic. Also ainu language is not paleosiberian. The areal classification was accepted in past. But researches change this. We/wikipedia should update this. There are enough evidence. Also it is stated that koreanic is an isolated language. Altaic now seen as discredited by modern linguists. And if you mention areal classification, remember that korea is not in central asia. It is east asia, or sometimes north-east asia. Also you are ignoring modern facts and only belive your controversial or outdated source. I have writen you on your korean talkpage. You ignored and deleted it. Do you reguse a discussion. You only write noe to get not blocked. And even when you change or corrupt wikipedia pages it will not change the reality. Modern linguists all accept that altaic is obsolete and korean is isolated. Not to mention the newest genetic research from korean ulsan university that clearly show that koreans are not of northern origin. But you nationalists ignore all facts that do not fit your worlview. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/213.162.68.183" title="Special:Contributions/213.162.68.183">213.162.68.183</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:213.162.68.183" title="User talk:213.162.68.183">talk</a>) 16:44, 21 March 2017 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Those edits are from three days ago, and if you look at <a href="/wiki/User:Apollo_The_Logician" title="User:Apollo The Logician">Apollo The Logician</a>'s talk page you'll see that they've already been warned about them by an Admin.

<dd>Firstly, it was not clear that Admin had warned him. So to tell it is Admin rather than just another editor you have to go to their user page and search for a box saying they are an Admin? Not clear is it really?. Secondly Apollo The Logician came back with attitude. So not only does he act disruptively but carries on with his general attitude when he is warned. Of course he could have not realised that it was an Admin warning him but the Admin didn't bother to say that they were an Admin in their post on his talk page. Or am I missing something here? Honestly as an answer to your last question - block him - at least for a reasonable time to allow him to reflect on his behaviour. <a href="/wiki/User:Robynthehode" title="User:Robynthehode">Robynthehode</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Robynthehode" title="User talk:Robynthehode">talk</a>) 19:18, 21 March 2017 (UTC)

<dd>Lol. After an earlier ANI discussion today, <a href="/wiki/User:Lepricavark" title="User:Lepricavark">Lepricavark</a> has appeared to be attempting to confront me, editing the last two pages I had edited, (both of which he had never edited before) and making a snarky comment on the Charlottesville list more or less stating that he's going to get me for starting an ANI discussion. He obviously had no interest in the <a href="/wiki/Starkville,_Mississippi" title="Starkville, Mississippi">Starkville, Mississippi</a> page other than to seek me out, as he repeatedly misspelled the name of the article in his edit caption. I'm leaving for tonight, I am not seeking any confrontation with this individual.

<dd>I'm not sure how you can construe removing irrelevant content from an article as an attempt to confront you personally, and there was nothing snarky in my comment in which I <i>absolutely did not imply being out to get you.</i> Note that I made that comment, which it now seems you intentionally reverted, <i>after</i> you made a personal comment about me. I misspelled the article name because I though that was how it was spelled. It's hardly the first I've had a misspelling etched into my brain. It did occur to me you might not appreciate my edit on the Starkville page, but you do not own that article. You have a tendency to take things personally, yet you laugh it off when someone else objects to your personal commentary. <a href="/wiki/User:Lepricavark" title="User:Lepricavark">Lepricavark</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Lepricavark" title="User talk:Lepricavark">talk</a>) 02:42, 21 March 2017 (UTC)

<p>I came across a situation today where I've already dealt with the immediate circumstance — but because there's a much longer history to it, I wanted to ask for opinions from other administrators on whether there are grounds for a longer term remedy or not.</p>
<p>Over the years, <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NMEDIA" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NMEDIA">WP:NMEDIA</a>'s rules for the notability of radio stations have been considerably tightened up; what's relevant in this particular case is the clause that now deprecates low-power radio stations which only broadcast prerecorded <a href="/wiki/Tourist_information" class="mw-redirect" title="Tourist information">tourist information</a> as not inherently notable. Just over a month ago, one particular cluster of such stations was deleted by AFD at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Information_Radio" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Information Radio">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Information Radio</a> — within the past 24 hours, however, a user named <a href="/wiki/User:Nathan_Jay_Williams" title="User:Nathan Jay Williams">User:Nathan Jay Williams</a> recreated all of the articles again without making <i>any</i> improvements to demonstrate that the stations are somehow <i>more</i> notable than the old versions had indicated. I speedied all of the articles accordingly, and politely explained on the user's talk page why the articles could not just be recreated again — but several hours later, he blanked his talk page, moved it to <a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:CJ_Ramsey&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:CJ Ramsey (page does not exist)">User talk:CJ Ramsey</a> (which is not connected to a registered account), and immediately recreated all of the same articles a second time <i>despite</i> having already been advised that he couldn't do that.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the articles in question were originally created by <a href="/wiki/User:Nathan_Williams" title="User:Nathan Williams">User:Nathan Williams</a>. The Jay version is a new account registered on March 16 of this year; he hasn't edited Wikipedia under the old username since 2011. And while CJ Rams<b>e</b>y is an unregistered account, the old "Nathan Williams" <i>has</i> sockpuppeted in the past as CJ Rams<b>a</b>y — and <i>both</i> of the older identities were once known as regular creators of <i>hoax</i> articles about radio stations that didn't actually exist <i>at all</i> (or fake amateur Corel Draw logos for real stations). He stopped doing that <i>just</i> in time to avoid a permanent editblock for it, although he did once garner a two-week temp, and while his editing patterns remained problematic at times after that it never again reached the level of requiring an outright editblock.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>Literally within one <i>day</i> of first registering the new Jay account this month, NJW already found himself on the business end of a 24-hour editblock from another admin for repeatedly removing AFD templates from articles with active non-closed AFD discussions. So after re-re-speedying the re-re-recreated articles again, I gave NJW a <i>48</i>-hour editblock for disregarding my explanation of why it wasn't acceptable.</p>
<p>So this is my question: should I just let the 48 hour block run out and give him another chance to continue editing Wikipedia, escalating the block only if he misbehaves again? Or given that he's already garnered <i>two</i> temporary editblocks in just four <i>days</i>, should I combine that with all the problems he's known to have caused in the past and just bump it up to permanent right now? <a href="/wiki/User:Bearcat" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Bearcat" title="User talk:Bearcat">talk</a>) 02:52, 21 March 2017 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would assume so. One final thing of note - while I have no experience with this user, I do have experience with vandals. The user's Talk Page currently consists exclusively of a link to a seemingly random diff. This could possibly be evidence of intentional trolling or <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTHERE" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOTHERE">WP:NOTHERE</a>.

<li><a href="/wiki/User:NinjaRobotPirate" title="User:NinjaRobotPirate">NinjaRobotPirate</a> I would love to read that essay. <i>You can't possibly rangeblock all of them; they're too far apart. A rangeblock requires us to specify a range of addresses that must all be blocked, and the only way we could block all of them is blocking all addresses that begin with numbers from 58 to 121 — that's 64 of the possible 256 numbers in the first group, i.e. literally a quarter of all extant IPv4 addresses.

<p>Over the last few months I've repeatedly seen different IPs adding what turn out to be false birth and death dates and places, examples including <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Haim_Boger&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=771472296">this</a> or <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Avraham_Yosef_Shapira&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=769589884&amp;oldid=769417426">this</a>. They do occasionally add correct ones, but most of the cases I've seen are wrong. They almost always use the article title as their edit summary. Unfortunately there are probably dozens of articles where they've done this (I spot them when they do it to Israeli politicians on my watchlist). Because it's from a different IP every time, blocking is pointless, but I was wondering whether some kind of edit filter could be put in place to identify them by their edit summary? <a href="/wiki/User:Number_57" title="User:Number 57"><font color="orange">Number</font></a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Number_57" title="User talk:Number 57"><font color="green">5</font></a><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Number_57" title="Special:Contributions/Number 57"><font color="blue">7</font></a> 19:35, 21 March 2017 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Clarification</b> Possibly I need to clarify – I think this is one particular editor using different IPs, not a complaint about IPs in general – the reason being the same edit summary being used every time. <a href="/wiki/User:Number_57" title="User:Number 57"><font color="orange">Number</font></a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Number_57" title="User talk:Number 57"><font color="green">5</font></a><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Number_57" title="Special:Contributions/Number 57"><font color="blue">7</font></a> 22:34, 21 March 2017 (UTC)</dd>

I see <i>many</i> changes made to death dates, ages, weights, heights, and other numbers like this. Edit summary wouldn't be too bad, but I believe that we have an edit filter that tags changes to birthdate, weight, and height already. It would be interesting to see one implemented that could detect edits made by non-comfirmed users that change <i>only the numbers</i> in a birthdate, date, age, weight, height, etc and add/remove nothing else (so... an editor that changes 2015-05-10 to 1990-05-10 only), and then warns/rejects knowing that no reference was provided. Problem is... I know it would probably cause a lot of false positives and trip-ups...&#160;:-/ <a href="/wiki/User:Oshwah" title="User:Oshwah"><b><span style="color:#C00000">~Oshwah~</span></b></a><sup><small><b><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Oshwah" title="User talk:Oshwah"><span style="color:blue">(talk)</span></a> <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Oshwah" title="Special:Contributions/Oshwah"><span style="color:green">(contribs)</span></a></b></small></sup> 19:56, 21 March 2017 (UTC)

<li>IPs often change numbers in infoboxes, including heights/weights. I monitor some error tracking categories and need to deal with IP edits that break templates in infoboxes–not many in recent days, but usually there are a few each week, although I only see the changes that break certain templates. I don't worry about them anymore—if the WMF wants the encyclopedia to deteriorate who am I to object? After all, there are thousands of good editors who carefully monitor all edits to the over 5 million articles. It appears that some IPs have a hobby of changing numbers, perhaps to prove how unreliable Wikipedia is.

<p>An account <a href="/wiki/User:Halon8" title="User:Halon8">User:Halon8</a>, inactive since 2012 shows up and reverts two of my edits, which are reverts of a sock of the blocked user <a href="/wiki/User:%D0%96%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B5_%D0%B1%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%82%D1%8F" title="User:Жовтневе багаття">User:Жовтневе багаття</a>, calling my edits "vandalism" and asking me to go to the talk page (which obviously contradicts <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:BRD" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:BRD">WP:BRD</a>). I would normally decide that they are a sock of the same user and block them indefinitely, but they have a non-zero contribution from before 2012 which does not look as a contribution of <a href="/wiki/User:%D0%96%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B5_%D0%B1%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%82%D1%8F" title="User:Жовтневе багаття">User:Жовтневе багаття</a>.

There seems to be a concerted effort by several users to remove all references to autonomous movements in Russia. These sections should be strengthened with sources e.g. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.justicefornorthcaucasus.com/jfnc_message_boards/imperialism.php?title=window-on-eurasia%3A-separatism-remains-strong-in-tuva&amp;entry_id=1214897100">http://www.justicefornorthcaucasus.com/jfnc_message_boards/imperialism.php?title=window-on-eurasia%3A-separatism-remains-strong-in-tuva&amp;entry_id=1214897100</a> , <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JKuCE2crlhgC&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;ots=DgPz8NyGpt&amp;dq=tuva%20separatists&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=tuva%20separatists&amp;f=false">https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JKuCE2crlhgC&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;ots=DgPz8NyGpt&amp;dq=tuva%20separatists&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=tuva%20separatists&amp;f=false</a> rather than simply deleted (or deleted if they are genuinely non-existent/no longer active movements- but this need to be evaluated individually not en masse). It is difficult to see how removing large sections of content (where there is clearly evidence for this content) is not vandalism, but I do apologise if I was too quick to use this term. I don't appreciate being called a sock puppet for reverting what were likely politically motivated edits violating NPOV. Since these are contraversial issues they should be discussed on Talk and a consensus reached. <a href="/wiki/User:Halon8" title="User:Halon8">Halon8</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Halon8" title="User talk:Halon8">talk</a>) 12:32, 22 March 2017 (UTC)</p>

<p>I find wikipedia to be a fairly hostile place which is why I don't edit frequently. The editors who removed content can be seen on the history page - basically you and User: My very best wishes (I thought there were some un-named users as well but I may be mistaken). I was looking for content about Russia's autonomous movements and I found that it had largely been deleted so I reverted it. I apologise that I'm not an expert in wiki-lawyering. I am going to wait for others to weigh in on this. I really don't understand why this can't simply be discussed on the talk pages of the two articles. Many of the 'movements' listed are made up of only a few people (e.g. Yorkshire or Wessex) but without some sourceable definition of what is 'active' and what is a 'valid' autonomous movement then Russian movements should not be treated differently to the others <a href="/wiki/User:Halon8" title="User:Halon8">Halon8</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Halon8" title="User talk:Halon8">talk</a>) 13:06, 22 March 2017 (UTC)</p>

<p>An user with a different opinion about whether to post an article has twice removed a comment of mine about sourcing issues in a nomination. He has also posted a vandalism tag on my talk page. He has also struck out another user's comments previously. He appears to believe this is justified on the basis of my lack of civility, but he had made no effort to reach out to me to edit my comment while preserving my good-faith attempt to point out the sourcing issue with the article. He has also posted a ban tag on my talk page despite not having administrative rights.</p>
<p>Maybe I haven't read the ITN project guidelines clearly, but I believe this is a flagrant violation of standard project discussion guidelines.</p>
<p>I appreciate a quick admin response, to both of us, to clarify how this should progress. I'm happy to rewrite a more constructive comment on that discussion page, but I'm not doing it <i>because</i> someone decided to plaster vandalism templates onto my talk page with TW for a project page discussion comment. This feels like an attempt to harass some anonymous poster out of not posting a comment on the awful sources on their pet article.</p>

<dd>As I informed you on your user talk page after also removing your post, the proper venue for complaints about a nomination once it is posted is <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:ERRORS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:ERRORS">WP:ERRORS</a>. Further, your complaints seem to have to do with the content of the article itself- which if you dispute it, should be discussed on that article's talk page. No one has posted a "ban tag" to your page, but warnings, which anyone can do. <a href="/wiki/User:331dot" title="User:331dot">331dot</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:331dot" title="User talk:331dot">talk</a>) 13:45, 22 March 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm still confused. Was the problem that I simply posted in the wrong avenue, or was there a civility issue? The other user's comments are ambiguous about this. I didn't think WP:ERRORS was the correct page to post it, as it requires a <i>verified</i> error, whereas the problem with the original posting was that the central claim to significance is completely unverifiable.</dd>

<dd>As for going to that article's talk page - to be frank, I don't have much faith with finding an effective resolution on that article's talk page because there's another user has been edit warring in that article and repeatedly inserting unreliable sources in a disingenuous way. <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2017_al-Jina_mosque_airstrike&amp;diff=771589049&amp;oldid=771585013">example</a>. The quality and accuracy of that article seems obviously bad enough that it merits an immediate removal from ITN. I'm also simply not involved enough on Wikipedia anymore to want to waste 2 hours with a drawn-out conflict resolution process against some experienced user who is trying to push an agenda. This shit is why some of us left in the first place. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/73.61.16.86" title="Special:Contributions/73.61.16.86">73.61.16.86</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:73.61.16.86" title="User talk:73.61.16.86">talk</a>) 14:00, 22 March 2017 (UTC)

<dd>Please. I didn't remove your comments because of a difference in opinion; I removed them because they contained strong and unnecessary profanity, as well as being better suited at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:ERRORS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:ERRORS">WP:ERRORS</a>, which I <i>did</i> state in the first warning that you proceeded to ignore. <a href="/wiki/User:UNSC_Luke_1021" title="User:UNSC Luke 1021">UNSC Luke 1021</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:UNSC_Luke_1021" title="User talk:UNSC Luke 1021">talk</a>) 14:22, 22 March 2017 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Is profanity a legitimate reason to remove another talk page comment, and is it a legitimate factor in deciding whether a talk page comment constitutes vandalism (if that's even possible)? I'm not asking rhetorically, I want an admin to clarify whether I've completely misunderstood basic guidelines for a decade. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/73.61.16.86" title="Special:Contributions/73.61.16.86">73.61.16.86</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:73.61.16.86" title="User talk:73.61.16.86">talk</a>) 14:24, 22 March 2017 (UTC)

<dd>Unnecessary profanity can amount to offensive content, which is against the rules. The usage of the template was justified. I generally don't use the specific templates but rather the generic vandalism template, so I hope that this clears up any confusion. <a href="/wiki/User:UNSC_Luke_1021" title="User:UNSC Luke 1021">UNSC Luke 1021</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:UNSC_Luke_1021" title="User talk:UNSC Luke 1021">talk</a>) 15:22, 22 March 2017 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree with your premise that it is, under any circumstances, appropriate for a user involved in a talk page discussion to remove another user's comments out of a personal perception of "unnecessary profanity". I don't have a particular interest in continuing this dispute, as I've stopped using Wikipedia formally for years, but this seems like such an absurd breach of etiquette to me that I want an admin to weigh in on whether this is indeed permissible.</dd>
<dd>I also suggest you follow <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:AGF" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and try not to use vandalism tags for content-related or policy-related disputes. I'll in turn follow the same principle and assume you weren't aware that this is not the intended use of either those tags, or of Twinkle as an anti-vandalism tool. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/73.61.16.86" title="Special:Contributions/73.61.16.86">73.61.16.86</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:73.61.16.86" title="User talk:73.61.16.86">talk</a>) 18:39, 22 March 2017 (UTC)

Let me clarify the context for people who are confused: 1. multiple sources agree that a mosque had been hit by an air strike; 2. the U.S. released a statement that they had an air strike on a nearby location, but specifically denies hitting the mosque; 3. this user wants to write "the U.S. admits hitting the mosque" in both the ITN stub and in the article, and his justification is "Do you really think the US would admit to a mistake?" <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/73.61.16.86" title="Special:Contributions/73.61.16.86">73.61.16.86</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:73.61.16.86" title="User talk:73.61.16.86">talk</a>) 14:06, 22 March 2017 (UTC)

<dd>I would say that an article posted with incorrect or invalid sourcing would qualify as an error.

<dd>If you don't have faith in using the article talk page, that's something only you can decide, but talk page discussion is how things are done here.

If you don't find that problematic, it's up to you, but I'm not wasting more time to help this piss-poor project while the two of you are too preoccupied with policing vulgarity instead of fixing the egregious soapboxing on a current front page article. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/73.61.16.86" title="Special:Contributions/73.61.16.86">73.61.16.86</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:73.61.16.86" title="User talk:73.61.16.86">talk</a>) 14:30, 22 March 2017 (UTC)

Your argument amounts to asking me if I'm willing to fix the article, wrestle it away from someone who has clearly not been editing that page in good faith, and/or try to get it removed from the front page because it is <i>so</i> clearly a violation of policies on reliable sourcing, soapboxing, and copyright.</dd>
<dd>And no, that's not something I am willing to do. Here's a better suggestion: before that nomination closed, the two of you could have spent 5 minutes looking at that page, realize that it has a source that has never been cited on politics/news on wikipedia as a reliable source, or just read the comments from the article creator who was discussing his own conjectures about what happened during the discussion of the nomination itself. At that point, write "oppose", explain the rationale cogently, and maybe we wouldn't have had a trash article with fabricated claims on the front page for more than a day. But instead, you've dedicated most of your attention to policing my single use of the word "fuck" in a discussion comment. Let me clarify: I'm not whining here because I think <i>I'm</i> a victim, I'm whining here because some of you clearly enjoy spending more effort on meta/community edits and templating other users rather than taking an easy opportunity to fix completely broken content in a front page article, and are still lecturing to me about <i>my</i> effort. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/73.61.16.86" title="Special:Contributions/73.61.16.86">73.61.16.86</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:73.61.16.86" title="User talk:73.61.16.86">talk</a>) 18:45, 22 March 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Responding to an edit summary that mentioned me: A user posting a valid concern to the wrong page by mistake or ignorance is not disruptive. I can still remember being a newbie and posting messages to user pages instead of talk pages a few times. If I had been plonked with increasing levels of disruptive warning templates then I might have concluded Wikipedia was a pretty hostile place and acted accordingly. Instead, I received non-templated messages telling me the proper place to post and moving the posts for me (even after I did this a couple times). Sometimes, a message without a template makes the message clearer. As for the profanity, content posted on the main page often causes strong feelings to occur so the occasional "WTF?!" is understandable. --<a href="/wiki/User:NeilN" title="User:NeilN"><b style="color:navy">Neil<span style="color:red">N</span></b></a> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:NeilN" title="User talk:NeilN"><i style="color:blue">talk to me</i></a></sup> 19:17, 22 March 2017 (UTC)</p>

I can't explain why no one called him on it; I, for one, simply never noticed, and when I did it didn't register.

<p>Choreographer<a href="/wiki/Trisha_Brown" title="Trisha Brown">Trisha Brown</a> recently died. As part of working on her article, I searched for a free image to add to it, having also done so in the past, but was unable, again, to find one. As part of the most recent search I utilized Google images, Flickr, the NYPL Digital collection, and the Library of Congress Digital collection. Unable to find a free image, and the subject now being deceased, I added a non-free photograph <a href="/wiki/File:Trisha_Brown.jpg" title="File:Trisha Brown.jpg">File:Trisha Brown.jpg</a> to the infobox, a headshot reduced from a full-body shot. The image is properly rationaled, and, because the subject is now dead, there is no possibility of a new free image of the person being created.</p>
<p>Admin <a href="/wiki/User:Stephen" title="User:Stephen">User:Stephen</a> has continuously removed the image, on the grounds that an adequate search was not performed for a free image. I'm not sure how, exactly, Stephen knows how much or how little of a search I performed, nor how much searching took place in the past, but in any case, as far as I am aware there is no pre-set time required for a free-image search before a non-free image can be used, so Stephen's removal is both unsupported by policy, and out of process, as we have a procedure for discussion of non-free images.</p>
<p>I request that an admin inform Stephen that he should stop his removal of the image from the article. <a href="/wiki/User:Beyond_My_Ken" title="User:Beyond My Ken">Beyond My Ken</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Beyond_My_Ken" title="User talk:Beyond My Ken">talk</a>) 13:32, 23 March 2017 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While AGF that you did, can you point to where you've tried to document what image searching you've done before her death? For NFC images after death, we usually want editors to wait roughly 3 months to allow an appropriate free search to be done (including if possible approaching friends and family after a period of mourning); however, if you can readily demonstrate the search for free images in the past without luck, that time period can be made much shorter. There is an element of AGF, and here, BMK is a long-established editor that seems well aware of NFC so that AGF has significant weight, but in Stephen's shoes, I don't see anything on the talk page to assume an image search had been done in the past, which is why if you had documented past efforts, that would give more strength to the argument to shorten the wait. --<a href="/wiki/User:Masem" title="User:Masem">M<font size="-3">ASEM</font></a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Masem" title="User talk:Masem">t</a>) 13:46, 23 March 2017 (UTC)

<dd>Please point out where in policy it requires a 3 month waiting period <i><b>or</b></i> documentation of the search. And how, for heaven's sake, am supposed to "document" my actions?

<dl>
<dd><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NFCI#10" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NFCI">WP:NFCI#10</a> presently says a month but current discussion and general past practice has been closer to 3. And the aspect of documentation is something under current discussion too, as to help editors shorten this period. You could have documented it by having a comment at the talk page "Anyone have a free image of this person? I've at X,Y, Z with no luck...".</dd>
<dd>The whole point of this period is to avoid lazy editors that simply think "Person is dead = no chance of making a non-free = can use non-free immediately". We need editors to be a bit more aggressive in searching out free images before resorting to non-free, because often you can find free images in other atypical places that existed before death. And while we can't force editors to contact copyright holders, or copyright holders to license works freely, this is still a step that should be encouraged. Hence why the waiting period to encourage editors to go seek out those images. They may, they may not, but it avoids rushing to include non-free just because the person died. That's why if you have noted previously that you tried to search for free and failed, that's a valid reason to keep.</dd>
<dd>Now I'm not saying Stephen's in the right here. We don't want to encourage hard numbers here (as soon as you do that for NFC, it is gamed from lessons from the past), but Stephen seems to be enforcing just that. That's why I think in this case, with your veteran experience, we need to AGF that you did prior searches before the death with no luck; it would have been helpful if that was documented to make it a very clear case in favor of retaining the picture, but I still think it should be kept here. But this is an atypical case given that we are talking an experienced editor reporting their failure in finding free images. Newer editors generally do not have the history to demonstrate that they've reasonably tried. --<a href="/wiki/User:Masem" title="User:Masem">M<font size="-3">ASEM</font></a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Masem" title="User talk:Masem">t</a>) 15:40, 23 March 2017 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the clarification, I was unaware of the 1 month period in NFCC #10 (I don't know if that's new or not), although I was aware of the discussion of making a 3-month period, since I commented in the discussion. And I don't want it to seem that I am married to this image or <i><b>any</b></i> non-free image - if someone better at searching then I can find a usable free image, I'm fine with using it, unless it's of such terrible quality that it demeans the subject and the page. As for my prior search, I don't think I can document it, as I didn't make any edits to the article at that time. (It's not unusual for me to search for free images when an infobox of a prominent person is empty.)<a href="/wiki/User:Beyond_My_Ken" title="User:Beyond My Ken">Beyond My Ken</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Beyond_My_Ken" title="User talk:Beyond My Ken">talk</a>) 16:12, 23 March 2017 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Given how pendantic some NFC-handling admins are, that's probably a good action, but again, I do want to stress the need that such admins should consider the editor that has added the image and consider AGF that a search had been done, particularly if they are a major contributor to the article. If this was a random IP adding the same image, sure Stephen's actions are completely legit. Here, it's more vague but I would definitely support inclusion at this point. --<a href="/wiki/User:Masem" title="User:Masem">M<font size="-3">ASEM</font></a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Masem" title="User talk:Masem">t</a>) 17:22, 23 March 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Aye, the problem has been certain editors trawling through recent deaths and adding any old non-free image to their articles <i>without</i> any attempt to locate a free image.

Certified Gangsta was one of his earliest accounts, and he has now returned to that name after being gone for four years. AFAIK, he used to mostly change his name per the proper procedures, which means the block log has come with him. Bonafide.hustla and Freestyle.king are, however, exceptions: those blocks (quite numerous) are <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Block/Bonafide.hustla">here</a> and <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Block/Freestyle.king">here</a>. Please note that there are <i>links</i> to those logs in Certified Gangsta's log: look for <a href="/wiki/User:East718" title="User:East718">User:East718</a>'s dummy entry on 21 November 2008.</p>
<p>All clear so far? My problem is this: in 2013, <a href="/wiki/User:Od_Mishehu" title="User:Od Mishehu">Od Mishehu</a> created a page in Certified Gangsta's <i>own userspace</i>, containing a list of six other blocks, all of them from 2006. These old blocks seem to be all <i>now</i> under the name Certified Gangsta, so I don't understand why they don't appear in <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/block&amp;page=User%3ACertified+Gangsta">Certified Gangsta's regular block log</a>. The technicalities of this are beyond me, and I appeal to people to please <i>not</i> explain it here, unless against all the odds it has some interest.</p>
<p>Certified Gangsta doesn't like having this page in his userspace, and has blanked it and asked me to delete it. User request to delete subpages in their own space falls under the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:U1" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:U1">WP:U1</a> speedy criterion, but the case was unusual, and Od Mishehu had specifically written on the page "<b>Note</b>: Please note that this page should not be deleted even if the user requests for it. This is the user's record under old user names."<a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Certified_Gangsta/block_log&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=535690663">[81]</a> Therefore, I asked Od Mishehu privately if he was all right with me deleting the page, but he's not, and refers to the specifics of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:U1" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:U1">WP:U1</a>: "In some rare cases there may be administrative need to retain the page."</p>
<p>I would still like to delete the page, and would like to know what the community thinks. My reason is twofold:</p>
<p>1. I don't see that we need such a scrupulous record at all of blocks that are <i>so old</i>, 2006. Wikipedia is not a bureaucracy.</p>
<p>2. If we really do need that ancient record, then I don't understand the need to keep the list in CG's <i>own space</i>, which is humiliating and chafing for him. I'll acknowledge that he has always been a problematic user, but he's nevertheless a person, and deserves personal consideration just like everybody else. I see where Od Mishehu was coming from when he created the page in 2013, but why not move it somewhere less hurtful, now that the user has returned? Od Mishehu has put a note in CG's block log, at the top, linking to the page. Now obviously that note in the log could just as well link to the same information somewhere else — say in Od Mishehu's own space. I'd appreciate knowing what people think.</p>

That way everyone would be happy, no public humiliation for the Gangsta' but easily readable for the only ones who could possibly be interested in it, i.e. admins. 18:10, 23 March 2017 (UTC) <small class="autosigned">—&#160;Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/wiki/User:Thomas.W" title="User:Thomas.W">Thomas.W</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Thomas.W#top" title="User talk:Thomas.W">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Thomas.W" title="Special:Contributions/Thomas.W">contribs</a>)</small></li>

<dd>We're talking here about a user who has repeatedly changed usernames, and who I suspect (although this is only an opinion) does this to try and prevent users from "remembering" him. He ran for MEDCOM under one username, 2 RFAs undr 2 other names (the second one being <span class="plainlinks"><a class="external text" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Certified.Gangsta">Certified.Gangsta</a></span>, in June 2008), and was back in the December 2008 ArbCom elections under yet a different name. He subsequently ran for ArbCom twice more, the second time under yet a different name. A user like this needs to keep his record with him for everyone to see. Unlike most of us, though, there is a good reason to hide part of it: he got renamed twice before the block logs were transfered for renamed users, and those old names were taken by known troll. This pagfeis a way to keep <i>his</i> blocks, under those names, with him - without making him look like this specific troll at a glance. Admins can confirm that when I created this page, I also hid a dummy line in his block log linking to these 2 accounts. <a href="/wiki/User:Od_Mishehu" title="User:Od Mishehu">עוד&#160;מישהו</a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Od_Mishehu" title="User talk:Od Mishehu">Od&#160;Mishehu</a> 18:43, 23 March 2017 (UTC)

<dd>But, as I commented above, the other usernames' block logs are *already* listed in his block log, linked to by East718's note. If you're saying your way would have been better, that might be true, but the toothpaste is out of the tube, the usernames and block logs are all linked. This subpage is just a duplicate. If CG prefers it not be in his userspace anymore, it should be fine to delete the page. --<a href="/wiki/User:Floquenbeam" title="User:Floquenbeam">Floquenbeam</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Floquenbeam" title="User talk:Floquenbeam">talk</a>) 18:52, 23 March 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Oh, I see now</b>. I didn't know that East718's entry was only visible to admins; I could see it, I assumed everyone could. If there's consensus here that the entries aren't needed at all, then delete the page and keep East's entry hidden. If there's consensus here to keep one or the other (instead of just ignoring those old blocks) then I think the choice should be left up to CG: keep the page, or unhide East718's entry. --<a href="/wiki/User:Floquenbeam" title="User:Floquenbeam">Floquenbeam</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Floquenbeam" title="User talk:Floquenbeam">talk</a>) 19:03, 23 March 2017 (UTC)

<dd>I find it hard to imagine a scenario where some decision has been made on sanctions or rights and somehow this information from 2006 pushes things over the edge. The information is sufficiently stale so as to make the whole think look a bit pointy. <a href="/wiki/User:Timothyjosephwood" title="User:Timothyjosephwood"><span style="color:#a56d3f;font-family:Impact;">Timothy</span><span style="color:#6f3800;font-family:Impact;">Joseph</span><span style="color:#422501;font-family:Impact;">Wood</span></a> 19:46, 23 March 2017 (UTC)

<dd>Is this really going to make any practical difference, ever? Are we looking at a potential Arbcom candidate whose application would be stymied only by those small few blocks out of a lifetime of them? How about we get real, delete this stuff to help a real human person in their wish to come back, and go worry about more important things? <a href="/wiki/User:Boing!_said_Zebedee" title="User:Boing! said Zebedee">Boing! said Zebedee</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Boing!_said_Zebedee" title="User talk:Boing! said Zebedee">talk</a>) 19:55, 23 March 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello everyone. I am currently working on an article in my sandbox, and have been slowly putting together references. For some reason, the user 217.118.78.104 has deleted all of my references on multiple occasions for no apparent reason (as seen in these two edits: <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AAoba47%2Fsandbox0&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=771839188&amp;oldid=771838880">1</a> and <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AAoba47%2Fsandbox0&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=771838287&amp;oldid=771838052">2</a>). I would like this person to be blocked to prevent him or her from continuing to interfere with my editing in my sandbox. As you can see from this person's edit history <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/217.118.78.104">here</a>, he or she has a history of editing other people's sandbox. I would greatly appreciate feedback on this matter.
